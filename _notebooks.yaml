# _notebooks.yaml
#
# This file lists all Jupyter notebooks to be included in the build process.
# Only notebooks listed here will be converted to LaTeX, PDF, Markdown, and DOCX.
#
# To include a notebook (chapter, activity, homework, etc.), add its filename
# (relative to the content/notebooks/ directory) to the list below. The build system
# will generate all output formats for every notebook listed here.
#
# Notebooks not listed here will be ignored by the build pipeline and will not
# appear as downloadable sources on the course site.
#
# Example: To add an activity or homework, simply add its filename:
#   - hw1.ipynb
#   - activity_01.ipynb
#
# You can comment out lines with # to temporarily exclude a notebook.
#
# Paths are absolute from the project root (e.g., content/notebooks/01_notes.ipynb).
