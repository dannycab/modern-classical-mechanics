title: Modern Classical Mechanics
content: |
  Welcome to the interactive course site for PHY 321: Classical Mechanics 1 at Michigan State University, taught by Danny Caballero. This site provides book-like resources, activities, and course materials designed for sophomore-level physics and astrophysics majors.

  All content is delivered as accessible, WCAG-compliant web pages generated from Jupyter notebooks. You'll find:

  - Interactive chapters and activities
  - Downloadable files in multiple formats (PDF, DOCX, Markdown, LaTeX, Jupyter Notebook)
  - Clear explanations, worked examples, and reproducible builds
  - Local images and robust MathJax/LaTeX rendering
  - Accessible color themes and dark/light mode support

  This project is open source, constantly evolving, and welcomes contributions from students and developers. Found a typo or want to help? [Open an issue or pull request!](https://github.com/dannycab/modern-classical-mechanics)

  **Note:** PDF generation is being improved—some PDFs may be missing or incomplete if there are LaTeX errors. All other formats are up to date.

  ## How This Site Works

  This is not just a collection of Jupyter notebooks—it's a fully static, accessible website built from notebooks, with robust support for dark/light mode, accessible color theming, and MathJax/LaTeX rendering. All admonitions (notes, tips, warnings, etc.) are rendered as accessible, visually distinct boxes.

  **Planned:** Soon, you will be able to download each chapter/page as PDF, Markdown, DOCX, Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb), and LaTeX directly from the site.

  **Note:** The navigation menus are not yet fully functional, but improved navigation and download options are coming soon!
