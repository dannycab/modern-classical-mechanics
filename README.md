<!--
RELEASE v0.7 "Robust Routhian" (July 2025)
See [RELEASE-v0.7.md](RELEASE-v0.7.md) for details.

- Robust image handling in Markdown build: all images referenced in notebooks are reliably copied to _build/md/images and all image links in Markdown are rewritten to point to the copied images.
- No source notebook changes required; all fixes are post-processing only.
- Closes issues #11 and #12 (per-page download menus and unified build script improvements).

## üåê About & Webpage

**Modern Classical Mechanics** is an open-source, interactive, and accessible static website and resource set for Classical Mechanics 1 at Michigan State University. It is principally authored by Danny Caballero, but with contributions from many others in the physics education community.

This project is not just a collection of Jupyter notebooks‚Äîit builds a fully static, accessible set of web pages from notebooks, with robust support for dark/light mode, accessible admonitions, and MathJax/LaTeX rendering. The site is designed for clarity, accessibility, and future extensibility.

**Built with custom Python scripts (not Jupyter Book)** to convert Jupyter notebooks into a static, accessible website and multiple downloadable formats. *If you have suggestions for improvements or want to contribute, please [open an issue or pull request](https://github.com/dannycab/modern-classical-mechanics/issues).*

## üöß Work in Progress: Major Site Modernization (2025)

This project is currently undergoing a major overhaul to modernize the navigation, accessibility, and download experience:

- **Modern, accessible navigation:**
  - Single horizontal menu with dropdowns for children, centered below the site title.
  - Responsive hamburger menu for mobile.
  - Fully accessible and keyboard-friendly.
  - Built at build time from `_menu.yml` (no client-side JS for menu data).
- **Robust light/dark mode:**
  - All backgrounds and borders are forced to white (light) or black (dark) for seamless appearance.
  - No white lines or borders in dark mode.
- **Minimal, reproducible spacing:**
  - All vertical gaps between nav and content are minimized and consistent.
- **Legacy code removed:**
  - All old side-nav/side-menu code is gone.
- **Planned:**


**Planned / Open Issues:**

- [Integrate activities into the book (#7)](https://github.com/dannycab/modern-classical-mechanics/issues/7) <br>
  <sub>Labels: bug, enhancement, build, activities</sub>
- [Write an instructional guide for teachers (#8)](https://github.com/dannycab/modern-classical-mechanics/issues/8) <br>
  <sub>Labels: documentation, enhancement, teaching-guide</sub>
- [Mobile menu usability and dark mode issues (#15)](https://github.com/dannycab/modern-classical-mechanics/issues/15) <br>
  <sub>Labels: accessibility, bug, enhancement, mobile, dark-mode</sub>

**This is a work in progress!**

Some features and download links may be missing or incomplete as we continue to improve the site. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/dannycab/modern-classical-mechanics/issues) if you spot a bug or want to help.

## üöÄ Features (Current & Planned)

- **Static, accessible HTML site** built from Jupyter notebooks, with robust dark/light mode and accessible color theming.
- **Admonition support:** Converts all common admonition syntaxes (MyST, Markdown, code-fence, curly-brace, etc.) to accessible, visually distinct HTML blocks with LaTeX/MathJax support.
- **Image and YouTube handling:** Copies and renames all images, auto-fetches YouTube thumbnails, and ensures all references are correct in the static site.
- **Multiple output formats:**
  - HTML (website, in `docs/`)
  - PDF (`_build/pdf/`)
  - DOCX (`_build/docx/`)
  - LaTeX (`_build/latex/`)
  - Markdown (`_build/md/`)
  - Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) (planned for direct download)
- **Automatic copying** of all outputs and assets to the `docs/` directory for GitHub Pages hosting.
- **Accessible design:** All HTML output is designed for screen readers and keyboard navigation.
- **Dark mode toggle** in the HTML output.

**In Progress:**
- Per-page download menus for all formats (PDF, DOCX, Markdown, LaTeX, ipynb)
- Unified build script for all outputs
- Further accessibility and navigation improvements

---

## üé® Modern CSS Styling & Accessibility (2025)

- The site uses a fully custom, modern CSS (`static/css/main.css`) designed for clarity, readability, and accessibility.
- All navigation and main content links use consistent coloring and hover effects for a unified experience.
- Button colors are carefully chosen for both light and dark modes, ensuring strong contrast and visual appeal.
- Dark mode download buttons use teal by default and purple (matching the dark mode title) on hover, with correct text color for readability.
- All color choices are WCAG AA compliant for contrast and accessibility.
- The CSS is documented, maintainable, and removes legacy/duplicate rules.
- Emphasis on keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and accessible admonition blocks.
