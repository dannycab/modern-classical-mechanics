## ðŸš€ Release v0.9.1 "Persistent PoincarÃ©" Highlights (July 2025)

- **Mobile Menu Accessibility:** Navigation is now scrollable and touch-friendly on all small/mobile screens. All menu items are accessible regardless of device size.
- **Documentation Streamlining:** `README.md` and `build.md` have been further cleaned up, removing redundancy and clarifying theming, build, and usage instructions.
- **Release Management:** This release file follows the new pattern. The previous v0.9 release file is now only in the `releases/` folder.
- **Other Improvements:** Minor accessibility and usability tweaks throughout the site and build system. All changes are fully documented and committed.

See the `releases/` folder for full historical release notes.
