## How This Site Works

This is not just a collection of Jupyter notebooks‚Äîit's a fully static, accessible website built from notebooks, with robust support for dark/light mode, accessible color theming, and MathJax/LaTeX rendering. All admonitions (notes, tips, warnings, etc.) are rendered as accessible, visually distinct boxes.

**Planned:** Soon, you will be able to download each chapter/page as PDF, Markdown, DOCX, Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb), and LaTeX directly from the site.

**Note:** The navigation menus are not yet fully functional, but improved navigation and download options are coming soon!
