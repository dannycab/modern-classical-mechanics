# Modern Classical Mechanics

Welcome to the course site! Here you will find all chapters, activities, and homeworks as interactive Jupyter notebooks and downloadable files in multiple formats (PDF, DOCX, Markdown, LaTeX, and Jupyter Notebook).

**Note:** PDF generation is currently being improved. Some PDFs may be missing or incomplete if there are LaTeX errors (e.g., missing images). All other formats are complete and up to date.

## How This Site Works

This is not just a collection of Jupyter notebooks‚Äîit's a fully static, accessible website built from notebooks, with robust support for dark/light mode, accessible color theming, and MathJax/LaTeX rendering. All admonitions (notes, tips, warnings, etc.) are rendered as accessible, visually distinct boxes.

**Planned:** Soon, you will be able to download each chapter/page as PDF, Markdown, DOCX, Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb), and LaTeX directly from the site.

**Note:** The navigation menus are not yet fully functional, but improved navigation and download options are coming soon!
