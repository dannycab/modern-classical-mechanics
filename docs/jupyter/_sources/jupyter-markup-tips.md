# Tips for Jupyter Notebook Markup

Jupyter Notebooks support rich formatting and interactive content using Markdown, LaTeX, and code cells. Here are some best practices and tips for writing clear, accessible, and effective notebook content:

## 1. Use Markdown Cells for Structure and Clarity
- Use `#`, `##`, `###` for headings to organize your notebook.
- Use bullet lists (`-` or `*`) and numbered lists for steps or key points.
- Use bold (`**text**`) and italics (`*text*`) for emphasis.
- Add horizontal rules (`---`) to separate sections.

## 2. Include Math with LaTeX
- Inline math: `$E = mc^2$`
- Display math: `$$\int_a^b f(x) dx$$`
- Use double backslashes for new lines in display math: `$$x^2 \\ y^2$$`

## 3. Add Images and Links
- Images: `![Alt text](path/to/image.png)`
- Links: `[Link text](https://example.com)`
- Use descriptive alt text for accessibility.

## 4. Use Admonitions for Notes, Tips, and Warnings
- MyST/Markdown style:
  - `::: note` ... `:::`
  - `::: tip` ... `:::`
  - `::: warning` ... `:::`
- Code-fence style:
  - ```
    ```{note} Optional Title
    Content here
    ```
    ```
- These will be rendered as visually distinct boxes in the web output.

## 5. Code Cell Best Practices
- Start code cells with a comment describing the purpose.
- Keep code cells focused and short.
- Use `print()` to show output, or rely on the last expression for display.
- Avoid hard-coding file paths; use relative paths when possible.

## 6. Accessibility Tips
- Use headings and lists for structure.
- Provide alt text for all images.
- Avoid color as the only means of conveying information.
- Use clear, descriptive link text.

## 7. Miscellaneous
- Use horizontal rules (`---`) to break up long notebooks.
- Use tables for structured data:
  - `| Column 1 | Column 2 |\n|---|---|\n| A | B |`
- Use blockquotes for quotes or references: `> This is a quote.`
