        "# Week 1 - Overture: What is Classical Physics?\n\nThere are many different fields of physics; they are both distinct and overlapping. If we were to take a view of what kinds of physical systems that we wanted to investigate with different physics, we could organize them based on the system's size and speed of change:\n\n- [Classical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_physics): large, slow systems\n- [Statistical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics) and [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics): small, slow systems\n- [General relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity): large, fast systems\n- [Quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory): small, fast systems\n\nThese are not hard and fast rules, and, in fact, we often bring physics from different spaces together to solve complex problems. For examples, the fields of [climate modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_model), [non-linear dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_system), [astrophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics), and [particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics) use physical models and tools for each of the fields above. How we organize physics for ourselves depends on how we decide we want to look at it. However the first view where we organize the field by size and speed is a useful way to think about the different kinds of physics that we have developed thus far. The figure below shows how we might organize physics by size and speed.\n\n![Physics by size and speed](../images/notes/week1/640px-Modernphysicsfields.svg.png)<br>\n*Source: [Wikipedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Modernphysicsfields.svg)*\n\nClassical Physics is the physics that we developed before discovering relativity and quantum mechanics. It typically covers both mechanical systems and electromagnetic systems. It is also [the physics that we read about historically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_physics), which has its [roots in ancient astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_astronomy) and has existed across many different cultures. \n\n```{admonition} Wherever there were people, there was Classical Physics.\n:class: note\n\nYou might have heard of the development physics in the [Hellensitic age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_in_classical_antiquity#Hellenistic_age) where the Greeks used mathematics to study astronomical objects, or how [Newton's Laws of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_laws_of_motion) came to be. These are both examples of classical physics. \n\nBut there are many more including [astronomical analyses in Sub-Saharan Africa](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.200.4343.766) in 300 BCE, massive [scientific expansion in China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_and_technology_of_the_Song_dynasty) during the Song dynasty, and studies that pushed the fields of optics, mechanics, and astronomy in the [Islamic Golden Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Golden_Age). \n\nWhile we do not often present it, much to the detriment of our own field, [physics and astronomy were a large part of indigenous cultures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_astronomy) across the world including in what become the United States. \n```\n\n## Classical Mechanics\n\nWhen we define [Classical Mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics), at least for the purposes of this class, we will define it as the physics of large, slow, mechanical systems.\n\n- **Large** - Systems are typically big enough that we can see them with our eyes, or maybe with some reasonably simple optical tools. We're typically excluding the microscopic world of atoms and molecules.\n- **Slow** -- Systems for which we can observe their motion and track them \"visually\"; that is they move much slower than the speed of light. This is a critical assumption that we make in classical mechanics.\n- **Mechanical** -- Systems where the fields of electromagnetism don't come into play. We relax this is bit when we think of a particle in a classical E&M field, but the focus is still on modeling the particle and not the field.\n\n### Modeling Large, Slow, Mechanical Systems\n\n**Classical mechanics is a physics that allows us to model these large, slow, mechanical systems.**\n\nIt helps us develop an understanding of that process of making models and how we can use models to make predictions. It is a physics that results typically in [deterministic models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism), where we can predict the future of a system given its current state. This is because the language of Classical Mechanics is [differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation), which describe how a system changes as a result of influences from it's environment. It is often a [vector-based physics](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics)>) as it describes the pushes and pulls on a system in a given direction. However, we can often develop scalar models or systems of scalar equations that describe the motion of a system.\n\nUltimately, Classical Mechanics is a physics that allows us to interrogate the behavior of these systems and describe their [dynamics](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(mechanics)>). Through Classical Mechanics, we can describe the present state of a system, how it will evolve, and then use that information to make predictions about the future. What we learn from Classical Mechanics can become a set of powerful tools that we can use in many contexts.\n\n\n## Applications of Classical Mechanics\n\nWhile it might appear there's little room for using Classical Mechanics in research or in industry now, it turns out there's tons of room. It is still the physics that enables us to understand fluid systems, nonlinear mechanical effects, continuum mechanics, animal locomotion, and many other systems. Below are several examples of how Classical Mechanics is used in research and industry. We encourage to watch these videos as they demonstrate how the physics we will learn in class is really central to continuing to understand nature.\n\n\n### Fluid Mechanics at LANL (6 minute video)\n\n[Researchers at Los Alamos National Lab](https://www.lanl.gov/org/ddste/aldsc/theoretical/fluid-dynamics-solid-mechanics/index.php) do a variety of research using fluid mechanics models.\n\n\n[![](../images/notes/week1/myuD81326_o.jpg)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=myuD81326_o)\n\nSource: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myuD81326_o>\n\n### Biologically-Inspired Robotics (2 minute video)\n\nA [research lab at Georgia Tech](https://crablab.gatech.edu/) uses Classical Mechanics to model the motion of animals and then uses that information to build robots that can move like animals.\n\n[![](../images/notes/week1/Qme07fA3Fj4.jpg)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Qme07fA3Fj4)\n\nSource: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme07fA3Fj4>\n\n## Classical Mechanics in this Class\n\nClassical mechanics is a topic which has been taught intensively over\nseveral centuries. It is, with its many variants and ways of\npresenting the educational material, normally the first physics\ncourse many of us meet and it lays the foundation for further physics\nstudies. Many of the equations and ways of reasoning about the\nunderlying laws of motion and pertinent forces, shape our approaches and understanding\nof the scientific method and discourse, as well as the way we develop our insights\nand deeper understanding about physical systems.\n\n\nThere are a wealth of\nwell-tested (from both a physics point of view and a pedagogical\nstandpoint) exercises and problems which can be solved\nanalytically. However, many of these problems represent idealized and\nless realistic situations. The large majority of these problems are\nsolved by paper and pencil and are traditionally aimed\nat what we normally refer to as continuous models from which we may find an analytical solution. As a consequence,\nwhen teaching mechanics, it implies that we can seldomly venture beyond an idealized case\nin order to develop our understandings and insights about the\nunderlying forces and laws of motion.\n\nOn the other hand, numerical algorithms call for approximate discrete\nmodels and much of the development of methods for continuous models\nare nowadays being replaced by methods for discrete models in science and\nindustry, simply because **much larger classes of problems can be addressed** with discrete models, often by simpler and more\ngeneric methodologies. For example, [numerical integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_integration) is an enormously important tool in physics, and it is a method that is based on discrete models.\n\n### Analytical and Numerical Models Compliment Each Other\n\nAs we will this semester, when properly scaling the equations at hand,\ndiscrete models open up for more advanced abstractions and the possibility to\nstudy real life systems, with the added bonus that we can explore and\ndeepen our basic understanding of various physical systems\n\nAnalytical solutions are as important as before. In addition, such\nsolutions provide us with invaluable benchmarks and tests for our\ndiscrete models. Such benchmarks, as we will see, allow us\nto discuss possible sources of errors and their behaviors. And\nfinally, since most of our models are based on various algorithms from\nnumerical mathematics, we have a unique opportunity to gain a deeper\nunderstanding of the mathematical approaches we are using.\n\n### Computing is an Essential Tool for Physics\n\nWith computing and data science as important elements in essentially\nall aspects of a modern society, we could then try to define Computing as\n**solving scientific problems using all possible tools, including\nsymbolic computing, computers and numerical algorithms, and analytical\npaper and pencil solutions**.\nComputing provides us with the tools to develop our own understanding of the scientific method by enhancing algorithmic thinking.\n\nThe way we will teach this course reflects\nthis definition of computing. The course contains both classical paper\nand pencil exercises as well as computational projects and exercises. The\nhope is that this will allow you to explore the physics of systems\ngoverned by the degrees of freedom of classical mechanics at a deeper\nlevel, and that these insights about the scientific method will help\nyou to develop a better understanding of how the underlying forces and\nequations of motion and how they impact a given system. Furthermore, by introducing various numerical methods\nvia computational projects and exercises, we aim at developing your competences and skills about these topics.\n\nThese competences will enable you to\n\n- understand how algorithms are used to solve mathematical problems,\n\n- derive, verify, and implement algorithms,\n\n- understand what can go wrong with algorithms,\n\n- use these algorithms to construct reproducible scientific outcomes and to engage in science in ethical ways, and\n\n- think algorithmically for the purposes of gaining deeper insights about scientific problems.\n\nAll these elements are central for maturing and gaining a better understanding of the modern scientific process _per se_.\n\n### What We Hope You Will Learn\n\nThe power of the scientific method lies in identifying a given problem\nas a special case of an abstract class of problems, identifying\ngeneral solution methods for this class of problems, and applying a\ngeneral method to the specific problem (applying means, in the case of\ncomputing, calculations by pen and paper, symbolic computing, or\nnumerical computing by ready-made and/or self-written software). This\ngeneric view on problems and methods is particularly important for\nunderstanding how to apply available, generic software to solve a\nparticular problem.\n\n_However, verification of algorithms and understanding their limitations requires much of the classical knowledge about continuous models._\n\n\n\n"

        "# Week 1 - Notes: Introduction to Classical Mechanics\n\n## How do we formulate Classical Mechanics?\n\nIn the past, you have learned about [Newton's Laws of Motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion). These laws are the foundation of classical mechanics. They are used to describe the motion of objects in the universe. In this course, we will use these laws to describe the motion of particles and rigid bodies. As we progress, we will learn other formulations of classical mechanics, such as the [Lagrangian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics) and [Hamiltonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_mechanics) reformulations.\n\nNewton's Laws of Motion are a vector formulation of classical mechanics. The laws are as follows:\n1. **First Law**: An object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will remain in motion at a constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force.\n2. **Second Law**: The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. The direction of the acceleration is in the direction of the net force.\n3. **Third Law**: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n\nThese are the classic laws of motion that you have learned in other courses. How we formulate these laws mathematically is the subject of this course.\n\n## Newton's Second Law\n\n[Newton's Second Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion#Newton's_second_law) provides the mathematical foundation for classical mechanics. It provides a vector relationship between the net force acting on an object and its acceleration. The law is given by the equation:\n\n$$\\vec{F}_{net} = m\\vec{a}$$\n\nwhere $\\vec{F}_{net}$ is the net force acting on the object, $m$ is the mass of the object, and $\\vec{a}$ is the acceleration of the object. This equation is a vector equation, meaning that it must be satisfied in each direction. \n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nF_{net,x} &= m a_x \\\\\nF_{net,y} &= m a_y \\\\\nF_{net,z} &= m a_z\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nEach push in a Cartesian direction results in a proportional response -- an acceleration in the same direction of the net push. Let's go through a common example to illustrate this relationship.\n\n### Example: A Block on an Inclined Ramp\n\nConsider the box (mass, $m$) above on an inclined ramp (angle, $\\theta$). The box is at rest subject to static friction, $\\mu_s$. _What angle of inclination will cause the box to start sliding down the ramp?_\n\nWe start by drawing the [Free Body Diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_body_diagram) (FBD) of the box. \n\n![Free Body Diagram of Box on a Inclined Ramp; the arrows label the direction of forces acting on the box](../images/notes/week1/box_fbd.png)<br>\n[Source: homework.study.com](https://homework.study.com/cimages/multimages/16/diagram_2_450x3002352212273710292.png)\n\nThe FBD is a diagram that shows all the forces acting on the object. In this case, the forces acting on the box are:\n- The force of gravity, $mg$, acting downwards.\n- The force due to the ramp, which is both perpendicular to the ramp surface (normal) and parallel to it (friction).\n\nWe tilt our coordinate system to align with the ramp. This makes the normal force, $N$, act in the $y$-direction and the frictional force, $f$, act in the $x$-direction. The force of gravity is split into two components: $mg\\sin(\\theta)$ and $mg\\cos(\\theta)$.\n\nThe net force acting on the box is the sum of the forces acting on it, and is zero up to the point where the box starts sliding. At this point, the frictional force is at its maximum value, $\\mu_s N$. Taking the sum of the forces acting on the box in each direction we have:\n\n$$\\vec{F}_{net} = \\vec{f} + \\vec{N} + \\vec{F}_{gravity} = 0$$\n\n$$\\sum F_{x,i} = f - mg\\sin(\\theta) = 0$$\n$$\\sum F_{y,i} = N - mg\\cos(\\theta) = 0$$\n\nThus, \n\n$$f = mg\\sin(\\theta)$$\n$$N = mg\\cos(\\theta)$$\n\nAt the point where the box starts sliding, the frictional force is at its maximum value, $\\mu_s N$. Thus, the box starts sliding when:\n\n$$f = \\mu_s N$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $f$ and $N$ into the equation above, we have:\n\n$$mg\\sin(\\theta) = \\mu_s mg\\cos(\\theta)$$\n\nSolving for $\\theta$:\n\n$$\\tan(\\theta) = \\mu_s$$\n$$\\theta = \\tan^{-1}(\\mu_s)$$\n\nThus, the box starts sliding when the angle of inclination is equal to the arctangent of the coefficient of static friction. \n\n```{admonition} Check\nWe can check this with some numbers. Steel as a static friction coefficient of about 0.16, and rubber is closer to 0.8. Thus, the angle of inclinations for steel and rubber are:\n\n$$\\theta_{steel} = \\tan^{-1}(0.16) \\approx 9^\\circ$$\n$$\\theta_{rubber} = \\tan^{-1}(0.8) \\approx 39^\\circ$$\n\nIt seems quite reasonable that rubber would have a higher angle of inclination before sliding than steel.\n```\n```{tip}\nA few things to note about this problem:\n1. This was a static problem, such that $\\vec{F}_{net} = 0$.\n2. We rotated our coordinate system to align with the ramp. This is a common technique in classical mechanics to simplify the problem.\n3. We still used Cartesian coordinates to solve the problem. This is because the forces could be easily decomposed in the titled coordinate system.\n```\n\nLet's work an example that is dynamic, where the net force is not zero.\n\n### Example: Falling Object in One Dimension\n\nConsider an object of mass $m$ falling, but it is subject to air resistance. The free body diagram of the object shows that the forces acting on the object are:\n- The force of gravity/weight, $W=mg$, acting downwards.\n- The force due to air resistance, $F_{air}$, acting upwards.\n\n![Free Body Diagram of Falling Object; the arrows label the direction of forces acting on the object](../images/notes/week1/falling_object.png)<br>\n[Source: ibphysicsguide.weebly.com](https://ibphysicsguide.weebly.com/uploads/3/0/6/1/30617491/570899611.gif)\n\nHere we have chosen positive $y$ to be the downward direction. We want to predict the motion ($a$, $v$, $y$) of the object as a function of time. This is a very common problem for classical mechanics.\n\n#### Air Drag?\n\nFirst, we notice that we do not know the force due to [air resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_(physics)). We do know that the force is related to the velocity of the object. So let's start by writing the air resistance force as a function of velocity:\n\n$$F_{air} = F(v)$$\n\nwhere $F(v)$ is some function of velocity. \n\n#### Taylor Series Expansion\n\nBecause we know that the objects move slowly in classical mechanics, we can assume that the function can be expanded using a [Taylor Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series).  In general, the Taylor Series of a function $f(x)$ about a point $a$ is given by:\n\n$$f(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n$$\n\nwhere $f^{(n)}(a)$ is the $n$-th derivative of $f(x)$ evaluated at $x=a$. We can write the first few terms out,\n\n$$f(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + \\frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x-a)^2 + \\frac{f'''(a)}{3!}(x-a)^3 + \\ldots$$\n\nBecause we know that the object is moving slowly, we can expand the function $F(v)$ about $v=0$:\n\n$$F(v) = F(0) + F'(0)v + \\frac{F''(0)}{2!}v^2 + \\ldots$$\n\nWe can assume that the first term is zero, $F(0)=0$, because there is no air resistance when the object is at rest. Thus, the force due to air resistance is approximately:\n\n$$F(v) \\approx F'(0)v + \\frac{F''(0)}{2!}v^2$$\n\nWe call the first term the **linear drag** term and the second term the **quadratic drag** term. The linear drag term is proportional to the velocity of the object, and the quadratic drag term is proportional to the square of the velocity of the object. We also typically replace the evaluated derivatives with constants, $b$ and $c$ -- because they are constants that depend on the object and the fluid it is moving through. And thus,\n\n$$F_{air} \\approx bv + cv^2$$\n\n\n\n#### Back to Newton's Second Law\n\nIn the $y$-direction, the net force acting on the object is:\n\n$$F_y = W - F_{air} = mg - bv - cv^2$$\n\nAnd thus, the acceleration of the object is:\n\n$$a = g - \\frac{b}{m}v - \\frac{c}{m}v^2$$\n\nThis [differential equation]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation)) can be written in a variety of ways. One common way is to write the equation as a [second-order differential equation](https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Differential_Equations/Introduction_to_Partial_Differential_Equations_(Herman)/12:_B_-_Ordinary_Differential_Equations_Review/12.02:_Second_Order_Linear_Differential_Equations). \n\n$$\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = g - \\frac{b}{m}\\frac{dy}{dt} - \\frac{c}{m}\\left(\\frac{dy}{dt}\\right)^2$$\n\nNote that this is a nonlinear differential equation (i.e., there's a $(d^ny/dt^n)^m$ term where $m > 1$), which are notoriously difficult to solve in general. We can write it using the dot notation for derivatives (i.e., $\\dot{y} = dy/dt$, $\\ddot{y} = d^2y/dt^2$):\n\n$$\\ddot{y} = g - \\frac{b}{m}\\dot{y} - \\frac{c}{m}\\dot{y}^2$$\n\nWe can also use the velocity as the independent variable, $v = \\dot{y}$. Both equations below are equivalent:\n\n$$\\frac{dv}{dt} = g - \\frac{b}{m}v - \\frac{c}{m}v^2$$\n$$\\dot{v} = g - \\frac{b}{m}v - \\frac{c}{m}v^2$$\n\n```{tip}\nA few things to note:\n1. This is a dynamic one-dimensional problem, such that $\\vec{F}_{net} \\neq 0$.\n2. This is a nonlinear problem, such that the acceleration is a function of the velocity of the object.\n3. We are stuck with a differential equation that we need to solve, and don't have a simple algebraic solution (e.g., a simple antiderivative).\n```\n\n**How do we solve this equation to find the motion of the object as a function of time?**  We will come back to this, but solving differential equations is the primary tool of classical mechanics. We will learn how to solve these equations analytically and numerically in this course.\n\n\n"

        "# Week 2 - Computing as a tool for science\n\n\n\nOne of the first ideas that we developed was a model of a falling ball in one-dimension. We obtained the following differential equation that described the motion of the ball:\n\n$$\\ddot{y} = g - \\dfrac{b}{m}\\dot{y} - \\dfrac{c}{m}\\dot{y}^2.$$\n\nThis *nonlinear* second-order differential equation is the **equation of motion** for the ball. It is nonlinear because the term $\\dot{y}^2$ appears in the equation. \n\n**Can you think of an anti-derivative for this equation?** *Probably not.*\n\nWe can change the equation to a system of first-order differential equations by defining a new variable $v = \\dot{y}$, so that the equation becomes:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\dot{y} &= v, \\\\\n\\dot{v} &= g - \\dfrac{b}{m}v - \\dfrac{c}{m}v^2.\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nBut the equation for $v$ is still nonlinear. Clearly we need a different approach to solving this problem. In fact, we need a more generic approach to investigate equations of motion for systems like this. Most models of physical systems cannot be solved in closed analytical form. But, this approach to writing $N$th order differential equations as a system of $N$ first-order differential equations is a powerful tool in computational physics.\n\n\n\n```{admonition} Limitations of only working with analytically solvable problems\n:class: note\n\nThe problems that we often present in physics classes lend themselves to analytical solutions because we (collectively as a physics community) decided on the kinds of illustrative problems for students to work and solve. We did this at a time when computing was inaccessible and less pervasive in society, but also when we knew little about how people learn.\n\nThe choices we made in the past convey a false impression that most physics problems can be solved analytically. But more importantly, our choices convey that finding the solution is the goal of physics. This is not the case. The goal of physics is to understand the world around us. When we continue to focus exclusively on systems that can be solved analytically, we continue to perpetuate those impressions. \n\nThere's a movement of physics instructors across the world building these forward-looking pedagogies and curricula. They work loosely through a collective called the [Partnership for Integration of Computation into Undergraduate Physics (PICUP)](https://www.compadre.org/PICUP/). \n\nIn our class, we aim to build a set of investigative tools and approaches that we can use in Classical Mechanics.\n```\n\n## Scientific Computing\n\nIn this course, we will explore a broad class of problems using plotting and numerical integration as principal tools. These techniques and algorithms, along with the software we use, fall within the broader field of [scientific computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_computing). Scientific computing focuses on developing mathematical models and numerical methods to solve problems in the natural sciences and engineering.\n\nFor historical context, the [Timeline of the Development of Scientific Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_scientific_computing) provides an excellent overview. The roots of this field trace back to significant advancements long before modern electronic devices. Much of the foundational mathematics, such as [Euler\u2019s Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method) for solving differential equations, was developed in the 18th century by [Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler). Implementing these algorithms on computers was a natural progression in scientific problem-solving.\n\n### History of Computing\n\nThe history of scientific computing is deeply intertwined with the evolution of computing itself, a fascinating and complex narrative encompassing technical, social, political, and economic perspectives. Contributions to computing originated worldwide, starting with tools like the [abacus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus) in ancient China. Mechanical innovations such as [Pascal\u2019s adding machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_calculator) and [Babbage\u2019s Analytical Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_Engine) marked significant milestones leading toward the modern computer.\n\nTo get an introductory overview, the video below from Futurology is a helpful resource, but it is by no means comprehensive or critical.\n\n[![](../images/notes/week2/-M6lANfzFsM.jpg)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=-M6lANfzFsM)\n\nSource: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-M6lANfzFsM>\n\n## A Critical Perspective on Computing\n\nWhile the history of computing is often celebrated as a story of innovation, it is deeply entangled with systems of power, exploitation, and violence. Computing technologies have not only been tools of scientific progress but also instruments for surveillance, war, and perpetuation of systemic biases.\n\n```{admonition} Humans as Computers\n:class: note\n\nOf course, the development of electronic computers was a huge development for science. Prior to that, humans were employed to do the calculations that we now do with computational algorithms. This work occurred in a wide variety of labs where data were entered into tables, calculations were done by hand, and the results were tabulated manually. \n\nFrequently the work was done by those with less power in the laboratory and broader society (e.g., women, immigrants, and folks of color). A notable and well-known example is the work of the [Harvard Computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Computers) in the late 19th and early 20th centuries where women were employed to do the calculations that led to significant discoveries in astronomy. \n\n![Harvard Computers](../images/notes/week2/harvard-computers.png)\n\nOne of the most important examples is the work done by African-American women at NASA in the 1960s, as depicted in the book and movie [Hidden Figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Figures).\n\n![Hidden Figures](../images/notes/week2/nasa-computers-hidden-figures.png)\n\nWomen highlighted in this work include: [Williamina Fleming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williamina_Fleming), [Florence Cushman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Cushman), [Katherine Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Johnson), [Dorothy Vaughan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Vaughan), and [Mary Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Jackson).\n```\n\nThe algorithms driving modern computing are not neutral\u2014they reflect the biases of the societies that create them.

        "# Week 2 - Notes: Mathematical Preliminaries\n\nWe need a few things to get us started with making models of classical phenomenon. A few of those topics might be familiar to you; things like vectors, and derivatives. But we'll also need to introduce some new concepts, like the concept of [Discretization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discretization). In particular, we will introduce a powerful method for solving all forms of Differential Equations -- Euler-Cromer Integration. We start by introducing the concept of Euler Discretization, and then we'll move on to Euler-Cromer Integration later in the course.\n\n## Euler Discretization\n\nAnother useful formulation of Classical Mechanics uses discrete points in time to make approximate predictions of the motion. This is called the [Euler Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method). The Euler Method is a simple numerical method to solve ordinary differential equations. The method is based on the idea of approximating the derivative of a function by a finite difference.\n\nWe posit discrete time, like snapshots of the motion where a given measure of time $t_i$ exists in a discrete set of times between $t_0$ and $t_f$. That is, $t_i \\in \\{t_0, t_1, t_2, \\ldots, t_f\\}$. We conceive of the motion as discrete like the points in the figure below.\n\nIn this case, the points are equally spaced in time, such that $t_{i+1} - t_i = \\Delta t$. This gives a simple table of the motion of the object at each time step:\n\n| time | position |\n|------|----------|\n| $t_0$ | $y_0$ |\n| $t_1$ | $y_1$ |\n| $t_2$ | $y_2$ |\n| $\\ldots$ | $\\ldots$ |\n\nwhere $y_i$ is the position of the object at time $t_i$. Here, $t_i = t_0 + i\\Delta t$ -- equal time spacing -- and $y(t_i) = y_i$ indicates the position of the object at time $t_i$.\n\n### Predicting the Motion\n\nThis formulation can be used to predict the motion of the object.  Let's first define the average velocity over a time step, $\\Delta t$, like this:\n\n$$v(t) = \\dfrac{y(t+\\Delta t) - y(t)}{\\Delta t}$$\n\nNow, we know that at time, $t_i$, the velocity is $v_i$: $v(t_i) = v_i$ If we make the time step small, $\\Delta t \\rightarrow 0$, then the average velocity is approximately the velocity at time $t_i$. Thus, we can write the velocity at time $t_{i}$ as:\n\n$$v_{i} = \\dfrac{y_{i+1} - y_i}{\\Delta t}$$\n\n**Note** If we take the limit that $\\Delta t \\rightarrow 0$, then the average velocity becomes the instantaneous velocity. This stems from the [Fundamental Theorem of Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus).\n\n$$\\lim_{\\Delta t \\rightarrow 0} \\dfrac{y(t+\\Delta t) - y(t)}{\\Delta t} = \\dfrac{dy}{dt} = \\dot{y}$$\n\nWhat about the acceleration? We can use the same idea to approximate the acceleration. The average acceleration is given by:\n\n$$a(t) = \\dfrac{v(t+\\Delta t) - v(t)}{\\Delta t}$$\n\nAnd thus, the acceleration at time $t_i$ is:\n\n$$a_i = \\dfrac{v_{i+1} - v_i}{\\Delta t}$$\n\nAgain, if we take the limit that $\\Delta t \\rightarrow 0$, then the average acceleration becomes the instantaneous acceleration:\n\n$$\\lim_{\\Delta t \\rightarrow 0} \\dfrac{v(t+\\Delta t) - v(t)}{\\Delta t} = \\dfrac{dv}{dt} = \\dot{v}$$\n\n### Video Summary (13 minutes)\n\nThere's many videos covering the topic of Euler's method. Here's a video that covers the basics of Euler's method and how it can be used to solve differential equations. It somewhat follows the notes above, but it's always good to hear another perspective.\n\n- Direct Link: [https://youtube.com/watch?v=_0mvWedqW7c](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_0mvWedqW7c)\n\n\n```python\nfrom IPython.display import YouTubeVideo\n\nYouTubeVideo('_0mvWedqW7c', width=720, height=405)\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n<iframe\n    width=\"720\"\n    height=\"405\"\n    src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_0mvWedqW7c\"\n    frameborder=\"0\"\n    allowfullscreen\n\n></iframe>\n\n\n\n\n## Discretizing Newton's Second Law\n\nWe can use the Euler Method to discretize Newton's Second Law, and this allows us to predict the motion of the object using iterative methods. These methods are well-suited for computers, and we will learn how to implement them in this course.\n\nLet there be a 1D net force acting the x-direction on an object of mass $m$, $F(x)$. Here the force changes with position. We can discretize this force as a function of position, $F(x_i)$. The net force acting on the object is:\n\n$$F(x_i) = F_i$$\n\nUsing Newton's Second Law, we can write the acceleration of the object as:\n\n$$a_i = \\dfrac{F_i}{m}$$\n\nBut the definition of the average acceleration gives:\n\n$$a_i = \\dfrac{v_{i+1} - v_i}{\\Delta t}$$\n\nOr in terms of the predicted velocity, $v_{i+1}$:\n\n$$v_{i+1} = v_i + a_i\\Delta t$$\n\nOr in terms of the net force:\n\n$$v_{i+1} = v_i + \\dfrac{F_i}{m}\\Delta t$$\n\n**This is the Euler formulation for predicting the velocity of the object in the next time step -- given the velocity at the current time step.**\n\nWe pause here and will return to this formulation later, but this discretization is the basis for many numerical methods in classical mechanics, and we can apply it to solve the falling object problem above.\n\n### Looking Ahead\n\nThe development of the forward Euler scheme is the basis for many numerical methods in physics, and especially in classical mechanics. The video below is a longer introduction to the Euler Method and how it can be used to solve differential equations. It's a bit more advanced than the previous video, but it's a good introduction to the topic. We will revisit this topic a number of times, and you will have a chance to implement these methods in Python. *This video will be posted again when we cover numerical methods in more detail.*\n\n- Direct Link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MstPeOTCVzQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MstPeOTCVzQ)\n\n\n```python\nfrom IPython.display import YouTubeVideo\n\nYouTubeVideo('MstPeOTCVzQ', width=720, height=405)\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n<iframe\n    width=\"720\"\n    height=\"405\"\n    src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MstPeOTCVzQ\"\n    frameborder=\"0\"\n    allowfullscreen\n\n></iframe>\n\n\n\n\n## Additional Mathematical Preliminaries\n\nAs you have noticed, much of what we do in classical mechanics involves solving differential equations. We will explore how to solve these equations in this course. But also notice that most of the work involves vector manipulation and/or decomposition. Thus, we will need to be comfortable with vectors. Below are some mathematical concepts of vectors that we will use in this course.\n\n### Vectors and Coordinates\n\nThe figure below shows a vector in two dimensions. \n\n![Vector in Two Dimensions; the vector is defined by its magnitude, $A$, and its direction, $\\theta$](../images/notes/week2/2dvector.png)\n\nThe vector is defined by its magnitude, $A$, and its direction, $\\theta$. The vector can be decomposed into two components, $A_x$ and $A_y$, in the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively.\n\nThe magnitude of the vector is given by the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n$$|\\vec{A}| = A = \\sqrt{A_x^2 + A_y^2}$$\n\nThe angle of the vector is given by the tangent of the angle:\n\n$$\\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\dfrac{A_y}{A_x}\\right)$$\n\nWe can find the *vector components* using the magnitude and angle:\n\n$$A_x = A\\cos(\\theta)$$\n$$A_y = A\\sin(\\theta)$$\n\nIt's important to note that the vector components are the projections of the vector onto the $x$ and $y$ axes. The vector components are scalars, and the vector is a sum of the components. We can write the vector in several common forms:\n\n$$\\vec{A} = A_x\\hat{x} + A_y\\hat{y}  = A_x\\hat{i} + A_y\\hat{j} = A_x\\hat{e}_x + A_y\\hat{e}_y.$$\n\n#### Unit Vectors\n\nThe unit vectors, $\\hat{x}$, $\\hat{y}$, $\\hat{i}$, $\\hat{j}$, $\\hat{e}_x$, and $\\hat{e}_y$, are the basis vectors in the $x$ and $y$ directions. The unit vectors are used to define the vector components. \n\nInterestingly, the angle of the vector is not needed to write the vector in Plane Polar Coordinates ($r$, $\\theta$). The vector can be written as:\n\n$$\\vec{A} = A\\hat{A}$$\n\nwhere $\\hat{A}$ is the unit vector in the direction of $\\vec{A}$. Let's check that works out:\n\n$$\\vec{A} = A_x\\hat{x} + A_y\\hat{y}$$\n\n$$|\\vec{A}| = A = \\sqrt{A_x^2 + A_y^2}$$\n\n$$\\hat{A} = \\dfrac{\\vec{A}}{|\\vec{A}|} = \\dfrac{A_x\\hat{x} + A_y\\hat{y}}{\\sqrt{A_x^2 + A_y^2}}$$\n\nSuch that,\n\n$$\\vec{A} = A\\hat{A} = A_x\\hat{x} + A_y\\hat{y}$$\n\nCartesian unit vectors are fixed in space and time when in an inertial reference frame. However, the unit vectors in Plane Polar Coordinates are not fixed in space and time. They rotate with the vector. This is a common source of confusion when working with vectors in different coordinate systems, which we will come back to later.\n\nThe magnitude of a unit vector is always one, $|\\hat{A}| = 1$. And unit vectors are orthogonal to each other, $\\hat{x} \\cdot \\hat{y} = 0$.\n\n\n### Multiplication of Vectors\n\n#### Dot (Scalar) Product\n\nA dot product of two vectors is a scalar quantity. The dot product of two 3D vectors, $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$, is given by:\n\n$$\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} = a_xb_x + a_yb_y + a_zb_z$$\n\nThis product is also equal to the product of the magnitudes of the vectors and the cosine of the angle between them:\n\n$$\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} = |\\vec{a}||\\vec{b}|\\cos(\\phi).$$ \n\nThe figure below shows the relationship between the vectors and the angle.\n\n![Dot Product of Two Vectors; the dot product is the product of the magnitudes of the vectors and the cosine of the angle between them](../images/notes/week2/Dot-product.png) \n\n<br>\nSource: [Wikipedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dot-product-1.svg)\n\nMuch like scalar multiplication, a dot produce is distributive:\n\n$$\\vec{a} \\cdot (\\vec{b} + \\vec{c}) = \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} + \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{c}$$\n\nHere's the proof:\n\n$$\\vec{a} \\cdot (\\vec{b} + \\vec{c}) = a_x(b_x + c_x) + a_y(b_y + c_y) + a_z(b_z + c_z)$$\n\n$$= a_xb_x + a_xc_x + a_yb_y + a_yc_y + a_zb_z + a_zc_z$$\n\n$$= \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} + \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{c}$$\n\n#### Cross (Vector) Product\n\nThe cross product of two vectors is a vector quantity. The cross product of two 3D vectors, $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$, is given by:\n\n$$\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b} = \\begin{vmatrix} \\hat{x} & \\hat{y} & \\hat{z} \\\\ a_x & a_y & a_z \\\\ b_x & b_y & b_z \\end{vmatrix}$$\n\nThis results in a vector that has the following components:\n\n$$\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b} = (a_yb_z - a_zb_y)\\hat{x} - (a_xb_z-a_zb_x)\\hat{y} + (a_xb_y - a_yb_x)\\hat{z}$$\n\nA few notes about cross products:\n\n1. $\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b}$ always produces a vector and never a scalar.\n2. $(\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b})_i$ denotes the $i$-th component of the cross product.\n3. $\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b} \\neq \\vec{b} \\times \\vec{a}$; order matters.\n\nWhat is the relationship between $\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b}$ and $\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b}$? The right-hand rule gives the direction of the cross product. The magnitude of the cross product is given by:\n\n$$|\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b}| = |\\vec{a}||\\vec{b}|\\sin(\\phi)$$\n$$|\\vec{b} \\times \\vec{a}| = |\\vec{a}||\\vec{b}|\\sin(\\phi)$$\n\nAnd thus both magnitudes are the same, however, the directions are opposite. \n\n$$\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b} = -\\vec{b} \\times \\vec{a}$$\n\n## Units\n\nIn classical mechanics, we will use the [International System of Units (SI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units). The SI units are the standard units used in science and engineering. The primary units we will use in this course are related to the motion of objects:\n\n- **Length**: The meter, $m$, is the standard unit of length, $[r] = \\mathrm{length}$.\n- **Mass**: The kilogram, $kg$, is the standard unit of mass, $[m] = \\mathrm{mass}$.\n- **Time**: The second, $s$, is the standard unit of time, $[t] = \\mathrm{time}$.\n\n\nFrom these basic units, we can derive the other units. We also use velocity, acceleration, force, momentum, and energy. \n\n- **Velocity**: The meter per second, $m/s$, is the standard unit of velocity, $[v] = \\mathrm{length/time}$.\n- **Acceleration**: The meter per second squared, $m/s^2$, is the standard unit of acceleration, $[a] = \\mathrm{length/time^2}$.\n- **Force**: The Newton, $N$, is the standard unit of force, $[F] = \\mathrm{mass*length/(time)^2}$.\n- **Momentum**: The kilogram meter per second, $kg\\cdot m/s$, is the standard unit of momentum, $[p] = \\mathrm{mass*length/time}$.\n- **Energy**: The Joule, $J$, is the standard unit of energy, $[E] = \\mathrm{mass*length}^2/\\mathrm{time}^2$.\n\n### Example: What are the units of the drag coefficients?\n\nRecall the drag force, $F_{air} = bv + cv^2$. The units of the drag coefficients, $b$ and $c$, can be found by examining the units of the force. The units of the force are:\n\n$$[F_{air}] = [b][v] + [c][v^2]$$\n\n$$\\mathrm{mass*length/(time)^2} = [b]*\\mathrm{length/time}+ [c]*(\\mathrm{length/(time)})^2$$\n\nThe units need to match on both sides of the equation. Thus, the units of the drag coefficients are:\n\nThus, the units of the drag coefficients are:\n\n$$[b] = \\mathrm{mass*length/(time)^2} * \\mathrm{time/length} = \\mathrm{mass/time}$$\n\n$$[c] = \\mathrm{mass*length/(time)^2} * (\\mathrm{time/(length)})^2 = \\mathrm{mass/length}$$\n\n\n\n\n"

        "# Week 3 - What is Mathematical Modeling?\n\nNature reveals itself to us through interactions. We can tell from observations that it is nature's interactions that lead to its evolution. How nature is changing and predicting how it will change in the future is the work of science. In this work, we observe nature and its interactions to make models of those observations. We aim to predict and explain our observations of nature through this building of models.\n\nIn physics, our goals are typically to explain and predict observations of physical phenomenon. Here, we focus ourselves to those canonical things that physicists concern themselves with: motion, fields, waves, atoms, nuclei, and so on. \n\n```{admonition} Why the word \"observation\"?\n:class: note\n\nWe intentionally use the word observations here, because we are not simply talking about what we can see with our eyes. The visible spectrum is limited to a small portion of the [electromagnetic spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum). \n\nThese observations can come in the form of light, but also as sound, voltage, or current. For example, most instrumentation in laboratories will report only voltages or currents -- rather voltages and currents are what the equipment will measure precisely and report as measurements as different as [distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_rangefinder) and [shear stress response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheometer). \n\nLastly, we use \"observation\" because it includes the historical science that conducted qualitative investigations and conceptual observations. It is also language that includes the work of early cultures who made observations and constructed ways of knowing and explaining the world around them. \n```\n\n## What is a model?\n\nPhysics is a science that builds models. Typically, these models are represented mathematically in the form of equations or formula, but we can use charts, graphs, animations, and so on to represent our models. Models used in physics are often constructed by a community of scientists who have agreed on the model's utility and accuracy. Experimental observations are used to validate these models.\n\nModeling is the process of constructing a model. This process is often iterative where the initial ideas and assumptions are used to formulate a model. It is then tested against observations and refined. This process is repeated until the model is accurate enough to be useful. Physicists are model builders and model users. \n\nGeoscientist [John Aiken](https://mnky9800n.github.io/) made this short video when he was a graduate student at Georgia Tech. John cut clips from a lecture [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) gave. In this lecture, Feynman talks about the nature of models and the process of science.  John also interviewed different science researchers and teachers about their understanding of what a model is. \n\n[![](../images/notes/week3/dkTncoPqo5Y.jpg)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=dkTncoPqo5Y)\n\nSource: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkTncoPqo5Y>\n\n\n\n### Feynman on the Process of Science\n\n[Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) was a physicist who made significant contributions to physics, especially in the field of quantum mechanics. He was awarded the [Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1965/feynman/) for his work in quantum electrodynamics. In his time, he was known as a great teacher and communicator of physics. And [his lectures](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/) are still used in physics education today -- even for planning this class.\n\nFeynman was a gifted communicator; his lectures are lively and conceptual. Here's the longer version of the lecture he gave on the nature of models and the process of science.\n\n[![](../images/notes/week3/EYPapE-3FRw.jpg))](https://youtube.com/watch?v=EYPapE-3FRw)\n\nSource: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYPapE-3FRw>\n\n```{admonition} Richard Feynman's Legacy\n:class: warning\n\nWhile we acknowledge the importance of Feynman's contributions to physics and physics teaching, we should remind ourselves that he was not a perfect person. Feynman was also known for his [sexist behavior and comments](https://thebaffler.com/outbursts/surely-youre-a-creep-mr-feynman-mcneill). (*Trigger warning*: this link recounts instances of harassment) \n\nWe should not ignore this aspect of his life, and remind ourselves that we can learn from his physics and make a welcoming space for all people.\n```\n\n### History and Philosophy of Science\n\nIf you would like to dive deeper into models and modeling, there's excellent work in history and philosophy of science. The field studies how science develops knowledge, practice, culture, and so on. It studies important events and provides critical information on important and, often, overlooked folks who do science. For example, historian and gender studies professor [Sharon Traweek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharon_Traweek) studies the high energy physics field. Her book, [Beamtimes and Lifetimes: The World of High Energy Physicists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamtimes_and_Lifetimes) is excellent.\n\n```{admonition} Dame Nancy Cartwright (philosopher of science)\n:class: note\n\nOne of the more interesting scholars is [Dame Nancy Cartwright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Cartwright_(philosopher)) who wrote a lot about the 'practice of science.' Her philosophical work informed many of the innovations in physics and broader science education -- including many science courses at MSU. \n\nHer writing is very interesting, but the style of writing can be a challenge to read. This is the nature of academic writing in different disciplines. Her book called \"How The Laws of Physics Lie\" is worth a read. Here's a link to the [first chapter](http://www.generativescience.org/papers/nature/Cartwright-_1983.pdf).\n```\n"

        "# Week 3 - Notes: Making Classical Models\n\nThe central enterprise of physics is making and testing models of physical systems. These models we developed are based on the assumptions we make about the physical systems we are studying. As we characterize the system, we make simplifying assumptions that allow us to describe the system in terms of a few key quantities. These quantities are often called the [\"degrees of freedom\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_(physics_and_chemistry)) of the system.\n\nIn Classical Mechanics, we will use formulations of physics, such as [Newton's Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion), to describe the motion of particles. We can also use the [Lagrangian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics) and [Hamiltonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_mechanics) formulations of mechanics. These formulations are mathematical expressions of the physical laws that govern the motion of particles.\n\nTypically, those expressions are [differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation) that describe how the system evolves in time. Our work in classical mechanics is to develop techniques and tools that let us investigate the solutions to these equations. These differential equations are commonly called [equations of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equations_of_motion) (EOM). An equation of motion describes the evolution of the agents (particles) as they interact with their surroundings and each other.\n\n## Newtonian Examples of Classical Models\n\nFrom a Newtonian perspective, our equations of motion are often second-order differential equations. This stems from the fact that Newton's second law relates the acceleration of a particle to the forces acting on it. The second law is given by the equation:\n\n$$\\vec{F}_{\\text{net}} = m \\vec{a} = m\\ddot{\\vec{x}}$$\n\nwhere $\\vec{x}$ is the position vector and $\\ddot{\\vec{x}}=\\frac{d^2\\vec{x}}{dt^2}$ is the acceleration vector. Thus, Newton's second law is a general EOM that describes the dynamics of a particle of mass, $m$:\n\n$$\\frac{d^2\\vec{x}}{dt^2} = \\dfrac{\\vec{F}_{\\text{net}}}{m}$$\n\n```{admonition} What is Dynamics?\n\nDynamics is the study of the time evolution of a system in question. In classical mechanics, dynamics is the study of the motion of particles and the forces that cause that motion. In other physics, dynamics can refer to the study of the evolution of a system in time and space. And here, space might be an abstraction, such as a [phase space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_space). We study phase spaces later in the term.\n```\n\n### Example: Falling Ball with No Air Resistance\n\nConsider a ball of mass $m$ falling down. We define the positive $y$ direction to be down as in the figure showing the FBD of the ball. \n\n![FBD of a falling ball](../images/notes/week3/1d-ball-fbd.png)\n\nWe can apply Newton's laws to obtain the specific EOM for the ball.\n\n$$\\vec{F}_{\\text{net}} = m \\vec{a} = m\\ddot{\\vec{x}}$$\n\nThis is a 1D case in the $y$ direction,\n\n$$F_{\\text{net,y}} = W = mg = m \\ddot{y}$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$\\ddot{y} = g$$\n\nis the specific EOM for the ball. \n\n### Example: Simple Harmonic Oscillator\n\nWe will spend a lot of time studying the [simple harmonic oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_oscillator) (SHO) in this course. The SHO is a system that oscillates back and forth around an equilibrium position. It is a very common system in physics and is used a base model for many more complex systems. Consider a mass, $m$, attached to a spring with spring constant, $k$, sitting on a frictionless horizontal plane as in the figure below.\n\n![FBD of a simple harmonic oscillator](../images/notes/week3/sho_horizontal.png)\n\nThe EOM for the SHO can be derived form Newton's Second Law.\n\n$$\\vec{F}_{\\text{net}} = m \\vec{a} = m\\ddot{\\vec{x}}$$\n\nThis is a 1D case in the $x$ direction,\n\n$$F_{\\text{net,x}} = F_{\\text{spring}} = -kx = m \\ddot{x}$$\n\nAnd thus,\n\n$$\\ddot{x} = -\\dfrac{k}{m}x$$\n\nis the specific EOM for the SHO. As we will learn, this restoring force causes the mass to oscillate back and forth around the equilibrium position, with a well known frequency, $\\omega = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{k}{m}}$.\n\n## Turning Observations into Models\n\nOne of the more challenging aspects of physics is how we work to make models of the observations we have. This a long and challenging process in general, but if we have a general schematic, we can make progress. The hand drawn figure below provides such a schematic.\n\n![Framework for making models](../images/notes/week3/prelim_framework.png)\n\nIn the schematic, our observations are the starting point. Using our framework for physics (e.g., Newton's Laws) and making the appropriate assumptions (in blue), we can develop a model (in red) of the system. By conducting analysis and investgating the evolution of the model, we produce predictions (in green). We can then compare tose predictions to our observations to evaluate how well our model describes the system.\n\nIn this class, we mostly focus on the elements circled in purple where we develop models, and use them to predict. The core part of this class is the orange circled elements of modeling and predicting. We will spend a lot of time developing the tools and techniques to make these predictions.\n\n### Modeling Process\n\nMaking models of physical systems is greatly helped by considering the following steps:\n\n- Identify the phenomenon or system of interest.\n- Identify the interactions the system has with its surroundings.\n- Choose an appropriate physics framework to investigate the system (Newton? Lagrange? Hamilton? Continuous or Discrete?).\n- Sketch the system and identify the interactions, name them, and assign them to the appropriate framework.\n- Choose your coordinate system and define your variables.\n- Apply the appropriate physics framework to the system.\n- **Obtain the equations of motion**, and make predictions.\n\nLet's turn to an example you have seen before: the falling ball.\n\n### Example: Falling Ball in 1D\n\nConsider a ball of mass $m$ falling with air resistance. Here, we have already done some of the work above. We have identified the phenomenon, and started to indicate the interactions. \n\n![FBD of a falling ball with air resistance](../images/notes/week3/1d-ball-fbd-air.png)\n\nIn the figure above, we have identified the forces acting on the ball. We have the gravitational force, $W = mg$, and the air resistance, $F_{\\text{air}}$. We have chosen the linear mode for air-resistance, which is a choice of model given the assumption that the ball moves very slowly -- *this is not a good assumption in this case*, but makes the mathematical analysis simpler.\n\nWe have also chosen our coordinate system, with the positive $y$ direction pointing down.\n\nWe choose a Newtonian framework for our physics because we are familiar with it. And thus, we can develop the EOM:\n\n$$\\vec{F}_{\\text{net}} = m \\vec{a} = m\\ddot{\\vec{x}}$$\n\nIn 1d,\n\n$$F_{\\text{net,y}} = W - F_{\\text{air}} = mg - bv = m \\ddot{y}$$\n\nSo that the EOM is,\n\n$$\\ddot{y} = g - \\dfrac{b}{m}v$$\n\n#### Question: What happens with $\\ddot{y} = 0$?\n\nOnce the ball has no acceleration, the two forces are balanced. This is the terminal velocity of the ball. We can solve for this by setting $\\ddot{y} = 0$:\n\n$$0 = g - \\dfrac{b}{m}v_{\\text{term}}$$\n\n$$v_{\\text{term}} = \\dfrac{mg}{b}$$\n\nThis is the terminal velocity of the ball for linear drag. When the ball reaches this speed (and does so asymptotically), the forces are balanced and the ball will fall at a constant speed.\n\n#### Question can we solve this differential equation?\n\nThe differential equation $\\ddot{y} = g - \\dfrac{b}{m}v$ is a second-order differential equation for $y$. We can solve this equation analytically by recasting it as a first-order differential equation for $v$, which we solve for and then integrate to find $y(t)$.\n\n$$\\dot{v} = g - \\dfrac{b}{m}v$$\n\nWe will do that later, for now, let's hack off the drag bit and return to the simple falling ball. Our simplified EOM is:\n\n$$\\ddot{y} = g$$\n\nNote this is written as a second order ODE for $y$:\n\n$$\\dfrac{d^2y}{dt^2} = g$$\n\nIt is possible also to recast these kinds of second-order differential equations as a pair of 1st order differential equations for $y$ and $v$:\n\n$$\\dfrac{dv}{dt} = g \\qquad \\dfrac{dy}{dt} = v$$\n\nThis is a common technique in physics and engineering to solve second-order differential equations. Let's solve this for completeness.\n\n$$\\dfrac{dv}{dt} = g \\longrightarrow \\textrm{a constant}$$\n\nWe can integrate:\n\n$$\\int_{v_0}^{v(t)} dv = \\int_{0}^{t} g dt$$\n\n$$v(t) - v_0 = gt$$\n\nWe obtain the velocity as a function of time for constant acceleration:\n\n$$v(t) = v_0 + gt$$\n\nNow we can integrate the velocity to obtain the position as a function of time:\n\n$$\\dfrac{dy}{dt} = v \\longrightarrow \\textrm{a function of time}$$\n\n$$\\int_{y_0}^{y(t)} dy = \\int_{0}^{t} v_0 + gt dt$$\n\n$$y(t) - y_0 = v_0 t + \\dfrac{1}{2}gt^2$$\n\nWe obtain the position as a function of time for constant acceleration, the standard kinematic equation:\n\n$$y(t) = y_0 + v_0 t + \\dfrac{1}{2}gt^2$$\n\nWhy the 'plus' sign on the last term? Because we choose positive $y$ to be down, and the ball is accelerating down.\n\n```{note}\nThis is really useful, but is contingent on finding or knowing the anti-derivative of the functions we are integrating. That is not always possible. What might we do if we weren't sure that we could find the anti-derivative?\n```\n\n## Discrete Formulation of Newtonian Mechanics\n\nMost of our experience so far has been solving problems where we can find continuous functions that are the anti-derivatives of the functions we are integrating. This leads to standard formulae that we can use to predict or plot our results. \n\nHowever, there are very few systems for which we can write down EOMs that have known solutions. In these cases, we need to turn to numerical methods to solve the equations of motion. To do this, we need a discrete formulation of the EOMs. \n\nLet's focus on 1D:\n\n$$\\dfrac{d^2y}{dt^2} = \\dfrac{F}{m}$$\n\nWe can write this as a pair of first-order differential equations:\n\n$$\\dfrac{dy}{dt} = v \\quad \\textrm{and} \\quad \\dfrac{dv}{dt} = \\dfrac{F}{m}$$\n\nLet's allow ourselves to consider instead a small time interval of the evolution, $\\Delta t$. We can then write the velocity equation as:\n\n$$\\dfrac{dv}{dt} = \\dfrac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t}= \\dfrac{v(t+\\Delta t) - v(t)}{\\Delta t} = \\dfrac{F}{m}$$\n\nWe can turn this into a discrete equation by multiplying through by $\\Delta t$: prediction of the velocity at the next time step:\n\n$$v(t+\\Delta t) = v(t) + \\dfrac{F}{m} \\Delta t$$\n\nThis is the \"velocity update\" equation, or more generally, the [Euler step](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method) for velocity. Given the information at time $t$, $F(t)$, $m$, and $v(t)$, we can predict the velocity at the next time step.\n\n$$v(t+\\Delta t) = v(t) + \\dfrac{F(t)}{m} \\Delta t$$\n\nGreat! But that is just for velocity, can we do the same for position?\n\n**Yes**\n\nWe can use the same logic to predict the position at the next time step:\n\n$$\\dfrac{dy}{dt} = v$$\n\nIf we discretize this, we realize we just have the definition of the average velocity:\n\n$$\\dfrac{dy}{dt} = v_{\\textrm{avg}}$$\n\nWe can then write the position update equation:\n\n$$y(t+\\Delta t) = y(t) + v_{\\textrm{avg}} \\Delta t$$\n\n\nWhat is left is to determine what should be the estimate for $v_{\\textrm{avg}}$. \n\n```{admonition} Choosing $v_{\\textrm{avg}}$\n:class: note\n\nThe idea that we have to pick a value for $v_{\\textrm{avg}}$ is a key point in numerical methods. It might seem silly or overly subtle and it certainly the latter. We can select $v(t)$, $v(t+\\Delta t)$, or some average of the two. The choice of $v_{\\textrm{avg}}$ is the key to the accuracy of the method.\n\nAs we will show in a later homework, the best choice is $v(t+\\Delta t)$ as it preserves the energy of the system. \n```\n\n\n### Euler-Cromer Step\n\nTaken together, we obtain the [Euler-Cromer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-implicit_Euler_method) step for the position and velocity:\n\n$$v(t+\\Delta t) = v(t) + \\dfrac{F(t)}{m} \\Delta t$$\n$$y(t+\\Delta t) = y(t) + v(t+\\Delta t) \\Delta t$$\n\nThis method was accidentaly discovered by a high physics student called Abby Aspel. It was later explored by [Alan Cromer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Cromer) whote wrote up this [method in the American Journal of Physics](https://aapt.scitation.org/doi/10.1119/1.10903). \n\n\nIn three-dimensions, this method is simply written in a vector form:\n\n$$\\vec{v}(t+\\Delta t) = \\vec{v}(t) + \\dfrac{\\vec{F}(t)}{m} \\Delta t$$\n$$\\vec{r}(t+\\Delta t) = \\vec{r}(t) + \\vec{v}(t+\\Delta t) \\Delta t$$\n\n\n```{admonition} Erasing Contributions in Physics\n:class: note\nThis method should be called the Euler-Aspel-Cromer method because Euler started it, Aspel discovered it, and Cromer formalized it. \n\nIt is not because physics and physicists tend to erase the contributions of marginalized groups including young people, women, and folks from non-dominant groups.\n\n**Don't believe it?**\n\nRead about the [history of the MIT physics department](https://physics.mit.edu/about-physics/our-history/) and try to find the contributions of the many technical staff, non-tenure track faculty, and students who have made the department what it is today.\n```\n\n## Analytical Solutions to the Air-Resistance Problem\n\nWe can solve the air-resistance problem analytically. We have the EOM for velocity:\n\n$$\\dot{v} = g - \\dfrac{b}{m}v - \\dfrac{c}{m}v^2$$\n\n### Linear Drag\n\nLet's take the linear limit first, $c=0$. \n\n$$\\dot{v} = g - \\dfrac{b}{m}v$$\n\nWe can solve this equation by separating variables:\n\n$$\\dfrac{dv}{g - \\dfrac{b}{m}v} = dt$$\n\nWe can integrate both sides:\n\n$$\\int \\dfrac{dv}{g - \\dfrac{b}{m}v} = \\int dt$$\n\n$$-\\dfrac{m}{b} \\ln|g - \\dfrac{b}{m}v| = t + C$$\n\nWe can solve for $v(t)$:\n\n$$g - \\dfrac{b}{m}v = e^{-\\dfrac{b}{m}t - C}$$\n\n$$v(t) = \\dfrac{mg}{b} - e^{-\\dfrac{b}{m}t - C}$$\n\nWe can solve for the constant $C$ by using the initial condition $v(0) = v_0$:\n\n$$v_0 = \\dfrac{mg}{b} - e^{-C}$$\n\n$$e^{-C} = \\dfrac{mg}{b} - v_0$$\n\n$$v(t) = \\dfrac{mg}{b} - \\left(\\dfrac{mg}{b} - v_0\\right)e^{-\\dfrac{b}{m}t}$$\n\nWhen $v_0 = 0$, we find:\n\n$$v(t) = \\dfrac{mg}{b}\\left(1 - e^{-\\dfrac{b}{m}t}\\right)$$\n\nAnd as $t \\to \\infty$, we find the terminal velocity:\n\n$$v_{\\text{term}} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} v(t) = \\dfrac{mg}{b}$$\n\n### Quadratic Drag\n\nIn the case of quadratic drag, we have:\n\n$$\\dot{v} = g - \\dfrac{c}{m}v^2$$\n\nWe can find the terminal velocity by setting $\\dot{v} = 0$:\n\n$$0 = g - \\dfrac{c}{m}v_{\\text{term}}^2$$\n\n$$v_{\\text{term}} = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{mg}{c}}$$\n\n\nThus, we recast the problem in terms of the terminal velocity:\n\n$$\\dot{v} = g\\left(1 - \\dfrac{v^2}{v_{\\text{term}}^2}\\right)$$\n\nWe can separate variables and integrate:\n\n$$\\int \\dfrac{dv}{1 - \\dfrac{v^2}{v_{\\text{term}}^2}} = \\int g dt$$\n\n#### Assume we start at rest, $v(0) = 0$\n\nWe can solve for $v(t)$, by using the proper limits:\n\n$$\\int_{0}^{v(t)} \\dfrac{dv}{1 - \\dfrac{v^2}{v_{\\text{term}}^2}} = \\int_{0}^{t} g dt$$\n\nThis is a known integral and yields:\n\n$$\\dfrac{v_{\\text{term}}}{2}\\ln\\left|\\dfrac{v_{\\text{term}} + v}{v_{\\text{term}} - v}\\right| = gt$$\n\nWith the initial condition $v(0) = 0$, we find:\n\n$$\\dfrac{v_{\\text{term}}}{g} \\tanh^{-1}\\left(\\dfrac{v}{v_{\\text{term}}}\\right) = t$$\n\nAnd thus, we find the velocity as a function of time:\n\n$$v(t) = v_{\\text{term}}\\tanh\\left(\\dfrac{gt}{v_{\\text{term}}}\\right)$$\n\n\n\n\n```python\n\n```\n\n\n"

        "# Week 4 - Why does fluid drag complicate things?\n\nAs an object moves through the fluid, the molecules of the fluid collide with the object and exert a force on it. This collision changes the momentum oof the object just a little bit. The collision does so in a random way, but the average effect of all those collisions is to exert a force on the object that is proportional to a function of the object's velocity, $F(v)$. In some cases those collisions occur such that they make an impact; other times they might approach the object more slowly and slide over it in a more frictional interaction. These two behaviors are both fluid drag, but they are different forms.\n\nThe first form ($F \\sim v^2$) describes the behavior of things like a skydiver falling, a high-speed car, or a baseball thrown through the air. But it can also be valid for the movement of fish in water, or a submarine moving through the ocean.  Through those collisions, the distribution of those forces can cause intra-body forces, which can result in damage or deformation of the object. However, we often model the body as solid and focus on the way this form of air resistance changes the motion. \n\nThis form of air resistance cannot describe the behavior of objects approaching the speed of sound in the fluid. Objects moving a speeds that high can produce [shock fronts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_wave) that forces the fluid to go through abrupt changes in density, pressure, and temperature. Below is a figure of a shock front produced the nose of a jet flying at supersonic speeds.\n\n![A shock front from a supersonic jet](../images/notes/week4/shock_front.jpg)\n\nThe second form ($F \\sim v$) describes the flow of a viscous fluid around a solid object. You might think of this as pulling an object through some viscous oil, honey, or even molasses. The movement of the fluid around the object exerts a force and slows the motion of the object.  In water, this form can explain the motion of some of the smallest creatures on Earth, like the [water bear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrade), an amoeba, or a paramecium. \n\nWhat is interesting here is that these creatures have had to adapt to this form of fluid drag. [Edward Purcell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_M._Purcell) wrote a paper in 1977 called [Life at Low Reynolds Number](../../docs/papers/purcell_AJP_1977.pdf) that describes the motion of these creatures. He demonstrates that the physics in this regime requires creature to have adapted forms of locomotion that can take advantage of that environment.\n\n\n\n## Why do we often neglect air resistance?\n\nWe're in the business of making models of physical systems using the concepts and tools of Classical Mechanics. We've focused on Newton's Laws, which are a formulation of mechanics that starts from the concept of the force. \n\nWe often start with that approach because the mathematical tools that we have available to us when we are first learning physics are geometry and algebra. Forces are a vector concept and Newton's Second Law is a vector equation that holds in each of the three dimensions of space. This formulation lends itself to a decomposing problems often into two or three separate problems, one for each dimension, and then using some algebra to solve the problems. However, that mathematics limits the kinds of explorations we can do.\n\nThis is one reason why we neglect [air resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_resistance) in our first explorations of motion. Our models of air resistance are more complicated and require more advanced mathematics to solve. The equations of motion can be coupled and non-linear. In some cases, we cannot solve the equations of motion analytically and must resort to numerical methods like [Euler's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method), or the more often used [Runge-Kutta method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods).\n\n## The Reynolds Number\n\nThe different forms of fluid drag are often described by a dimensionless number called the [Reynolds Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynolds_number). The Reynolds number is a ratio of the inertial forces to the viscous forces in a fluid. \n\n* What are inertial forces? They are the ones associated with resistance to motion, the mass of the object. The more massive the object in a given setup, the higher the inertial contribution.\n* What are viscous forces? They are the ones associated with the interaction of the fluid with the object. The more viscous the fluid - the harder it for is to flow under the same conditions, the higher the viscous contribution.\n\nThe Reynolds number is defined as:\n\n$$Re = \\frac{\\rho v L}{\\mu}$$\n\nwhere $\\rho$ is the density of the fluid, $v$ is the velocity of the object in that fluid, $L$ is a characteristic length of the object, and $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid. \n\nYou can probably see who the Reynolds number characterizes the system of the object and the fluid as their are properties of both the object and the fluid in the equation. The Reynolds number can be measured quite accurately in a lab because the laboratory setups are typically designed to make the measurement of the Reynolds number easier. We will often estimate it in theoretical physics.\n\n### What is a characteristic length?\n\nThis length is a generic length scale associated with the flow, this can be the order of magnitude size of the object, or, in the absence of an object, the same for the pipe or channel in which the flow is occurring. If it's an airplane, it can be the wingspan, or the length of the fuselage. If it's a car, it can be the length of the car. If it's a sphere, it can be the radius, and so on. \n\n### What is dynamic viscosity?\n\nViscosity is the measure of the fluid's resistance to flow. It's how the fluid slides past itself. It's a bit of a harder quantity to describe, but you can think of it as the \"stickiness\" of the fluid. The higher the viscosity, the more sticky the fluid is -- really, for a given setup, the more viscous fluid will flow more slowly. The lower the viscosity, the higher tendency for a fluid to flow. Compare honey to water in the same vessel and temperature, and you'll observe the difference in viscosity.\n\n#### Measuring viscosity\n\nWe can sometimes measure viscosity with a [viscometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscometer), which uses a [capillary tube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary_tube) to measure the time it takes for a fluid to flow through a tube of known dimensions. However, this works best for [Newtonian fluids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_fluid), which are fluids that have a constant viscosity. \n\n#### Non-Newtonian fluids (in your kitchen)\n\nNot all fluids are Newtonian, and some fluids have a viscosity that changes with the rate of flow. These [non-Newtonian fluids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Newtonian_fluid) can be [shear thinning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_thinning) or [shear thickening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_thickening). Shear thinning fluids become less viscous when they are stirred or shaken, while shear thickening fluids become more viscous when they are stirred or shaken.\n\nBelow is a video from [America's Test Kitchen](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/) that demonstrates the behavior of a non-Newtonian fluid. The fluid is made from cornstarch and water, and it's called [oobleck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oobleck). \n\n[![America's Test Kitchen Non-Newtonian Fluids](../images/notes/week4/FrLh1GILomc.jpg)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FrLh1GILomc)\n\nSource: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrLh1GILomc>\n\nThe physics of cooking is fascinating and covers the field of [soft matter physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_matter). There's a free course on the subject offered by [Harvard and EdX](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/science-cooking-haute-cuisine-soft-matter-science-physics).\n\n### Low Reynolds Number Flows\n\nA low Reynolds number flow is a flow where the viscous forces dominate the inertial forces. The object is moving slowly, or the fluid is very viscous, or the object is very small. We typically think of these flows as being in the range of $Re < 1$. In these flows, the motion of the fluid is typically laminar; it flows in fairly smooth and parallel layers. Low Reynolds number flows can produce dynamics that is counterintutive. Below are a couple videos that explain the physics of low Reynolds number flows.\n\n#### Physics of Life - Life at Low Reynolds Number (15 minute video)\n\nThis video focuses on the biological aspects of the problem as the physics of low Reynolds numbers is important for understanding the motion of microorganisms. \n\n[![Physics of Life - Life at Low Reynolds Number](../images/notes/week4/gZk2bMaqs1E.jpg))](https://youtube.com/watch?v=gZk2bMaqs1E)\n\nSource: <https://youtube.com/watch?v=gZk2bMaqs1E>\n\n#### G.I. Taylor's Low Reynolds Number Flows (32 minute video)\n\nThis video is a classic from [G.I. Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Ingram_Taylor) who was a physicist interested in sharing the conceptual beauty of physics with the general public. He was also a pioneer in the field of fluid mechanics. In fact, Taylor's [groundbreaking paper](../../docs/papers/taylor_1922.pdf) on the stability of fluid flows between two rotating cylinders set off studies into turbulence. The [Taylor-Couette flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor%E2%80%93Couette_flow) is a critical tool for [studies of turbulence](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20365623/).\n\n[![G.I. Taylor's Low Reynolds Number Flows](../images/notes/week4/8Dst6V4CQME.jpg)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=8Dst6V4CQME)\n\nSource: <https://youtube.com/watch?v=8Dst6V4CQME>\n\n### High Reynolds Number Flows\n\nIn high Reynolds number flows, the inertial forces dominate the viscous forces. The object is moving quickly, or the fluid is not very viscous, or the object is very large. We typically think of these flows as being in the range of $Re > 1000$. In these flows, the motion of the fluid is typically [turbulent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbulence). Turbulent flows are characterized by chaotic and irregular motion. The fluid moves in a complex and unpredictable way, with eddies and vortices forming and dissipating. Turbulent flows can be very difficult to predict and model, but they are also very common in nature.\n\n#### Von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n's Vortex Street (2 minute video)\n\nThe [von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortex street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_vortex_street) is a pattern of alternating vortices that can form when a fluid flows past a \"bluff\" body, such as a cylinder or a sphere. The vortices are shed from the body in a regular pattern, creating a repeating pattern of alternating vortices. The von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortex street is an example of a high Reynolds number flow, and it can be used to study the behavior of turbulent flows. Below is a video of a von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortex street simulation.\n\n[![Von Karman's Vortex Street](../images/notes/week4/f3LmjJ1N7YE.jpg)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=f3LmjJ1N7YE)\n\nSource: <https://youtube.com/watch?v=f3LmjJ1N7YE>\n\n#### Turbulent Flow (24 minute video)\n\nTurbulence is a major research area in science. We don't fully understand it. We are trying to determine what triggers it, how to control it, and how to predict if and when it will occur. The problem of turbulence is frequently multi-scale such that behavior at one time or length scale is not well explained or connected to another scale. Additionally, the mathematics of turbulence is very difficult. It makes for an interesting and challenging research area. Below is a video that explains the some of the physics of turbulence. The first 4 minutes or so are at least worth watching.\n\n[![Turbulence](../images/notes/week4/RkewD966Y90.jpg)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=RkewD966Y90)\n\nSource: <https://youtube.com/watch?v=RkewD966Y90>\n\n\n"

        "# Week 4 - Notes: Equations of Motion\n\nAs you might have noticed in the last few weeks, our principal work is using models to develop equations of motion. Those equations of motion can then be analyzed, integrated, and plotted to understand the behavior of the system. This week, we will focus on the equations of motion for a few different systems. \n\nWe will set up the equations of motion for a 2D quadratic drag system and show it's intractable analytically. Here is where our use of [Euler-Cromer integration] can get us out of trouble. We will also develop the analytical solution to the 2D drag case when the drag is linear, which will show us how to solve these problems and compare them things we know.We will then quickly introduce two additional systems that are very common \"base models\" for more complex systems: (1) the gravitational bound planet system (a proxy for other central force systems) and (2) the simple harmonic oscillator (a common proxy for many oscillatory systems).\n\n\n## Two-Dimensional Quadratic Drag\n\nThe drag force in 2D can be written in terms of the velocity vector of the object as:\n\n$$\\vec{F}_{drag} = -D |\\vec{v}| \\vec{v}$$\n\nwhere $D$ is the drag coefficient and $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity vector. Note that this force is written entirely using velocity, there is no dependence on position. However, the velocity vector is also function of time, $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t)$.\n\n\n### Define the Coordinate System\n\nTo start this analysis, we need to define a coordinate system. Below, we draw the particle at some random time with the vecolicty vector shown. The axes are typical: $x$ is horizontal and $y$ is vertical. The drag force is always opposite to the velocity vector, so it will always be in the opposite direction of the velocity vector. \n\n![Coordinate System](../images/notes/week4/2d-falling-ball.png)\n\nIn this coordinate system, the properties of the particle are:\n\n$$\\vec{r} = x \\hat{x} + y \\hat{y} = \\langle x, y \\rangle$$\n$$\\vec{v} = v_x \\hat{x} + v_y \\hat{y} = \\langle v_x, v_y \\rangle$$\n$$\\vec{a} = a_x \\hat{x} + a_y \\hat{y} = \\langle a_x, a_y \\rangle$$\n\nwhere $\\hat{x}$ and $\\hat{y}$ are the unit vectors in the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively. And the magnitude of the velocity vector is $|\\vec{v}| = \\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2}$ as you might imagine.\n\nThe free body diagram at the point in time shown above is shown below. You see the gravitational force pointing directly downward and the drag force pointing in the opposite direction of the velocity vector. We continue to apply our coordinate system to the forces.\n\n![Free Body Diagram](../images/notes/week4/2d-falling-ball-fbd.png)\n\n### Apply Newton's Second Law\n\nWe now apply Newton's Seccond Law to the particle in the chosen coordinate system. The forces acting on the particle are the gravitational force and the drag force. \n\n$$\\vec{F}_{net} = \\vec{F}_{gravity} + \\vec{F}_{drag}$$\n\nHow do we apply the coordinate system to the forces? We focus on the diagram above. We start by writing the sum of the forces. For this, we take $F_{gravity,x}$ to be a positive value, $mg$, where $g$ is the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity. \n\n$$F_{net,x} =  F_{drag,x}$$\n$$F_{net,y} =  F_{drag,y}-F_{gravity,y}$$\n\nWe can now write the forces in terms of the components of the vectors, and we introduce the acceleration vector, $\\vec{a} = \\langle a_x, a_y \\rangle$.\n\n$$m a_x = -D |\\vec{v}| v_x$$\n$$m a_y = -D |\\vec{v}| v_y - mg$$\n\nLet's clean this up a little in terms of the components:\n\n$$\\ddot{x} = -\\frac{D}{m}  \\dot{x}\\sqrt{\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2}$$\n$$\\ddot{y} = -\\frac{D}{m} \\dot{y}\\sqrt{\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2} - g$$\n\nWe can try to focus on the velocity instead to simplify the equations. Then we integrate those equations to get the position.\n\n$$\\dot{v}_x = -\\frac{D}{m}  {v_x}\\sqrt{{v_x}^2 + {v_y}^2}$$\n$$\\dot{v}_y = -\\frac{D}{m} {v_y}\\sqrt{{v_x}^2 + {v_y}^2} - g$$\n\nRats! There is no analytical solution to these equations.\n\nThese are called [coupled differential equations](https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Differential_Equations/Differential_Equations_(Chasnov)/07:_Systems_of_Equations/7.02:_Coupled_First-Order_Equations) because the equations are linked by the terms $\\dot{x}$ and $\\dot{y}$. This means that we cannot solve them independently. We need another approach to solve these equations.\n\n#### Why can't we solve these equations?\n\nWe cannot form a solution because they are coupled and non-linear. Sometimes, we can decouple these equations (as we will see later) and produce partial differentials of the form:\n\n$$f_1(v_x)dv_x = g_1(t)dt$$\n$$f_2(v_y)dv_y = g_2(t)dt$$\n\nThese lead to independent equations of motion. We can use separation of variables to try to solve them. This is not possible in all cases, so functions are still not integrable analytically. But we cannot even form these partials, so an analytical solution is not possible in this case.\n\n\n\n## Linear Drag in Two-Dimensions\n\nAs we saw above, the quadratic drag case is intractable. However, the linear drag case is analytically solvable. The drag force in 2D can be written in terms of the velocity vector of the object as:\n\n$$\\vec{F}_{lin} = -m \\gamma \\vec{v}$$\n\nwhere $\\gamma$ is a proxy for the drag coefficient. The linear drag force is proportional to the velocity vector.\n\nWe have the same set up as before and same FBD.\n\n![Coordinate System](../images/notes/week4/2d-falling-ball.png)\n\nAnd thus the same coordinate system. The properties of the particle are the same as above. \n\n### Apply Newton's Second Law\n\nWe now apply Newton's Seccond Law to the particle in the chosen coordinate system. The forces acting on the particle are the gravitational force and the drag force.\n\n$$\\vec{F}_{net} = \\vec{F}_{gravity} + \\vec{F}_{lin}$$\n\nAgain, the gravitation force magnitude is $mg$, so we write the forces in terms of the components of the vectors:\n\n$$F_{net,x} =  F_{lin,x}$$\n$$F_{net,y} =  F_{lin,y}-F_{gravity,y}$$\n\nIn terms of the acceleration vector, $\\vec{a} = \\langle a_x, a_y \\rangle$, we have:\n\n$$m a_x = -m \\gamma v_x$$\n$$m a_y = -m \\gamma v_y - mg$$\n\nNotice that $v_x$ and $v_y$ are the components of the velocity vector; they can be positive, negative, or zero. We can clean this up in terms of the velocity components, and we have two linear, uncoupled differential equations:\n\n$$\\dot{v}_x = -\\gamma v_x$$\n$$\\dot{v}_y = - \\gamma v_y - g$$\n\n### Solve the Equations\n\nWe can try to solve these equations by integrating them. We can integrate the first equation to get the velocity in the $x$ direction as a function of time.\n\n#### Velocity in the $x$ direction\n\n$$\\dot{v}_x = -\\gamma v_x$$\n\nWe separate the variables and integrate:\n\n$$\\frac{dv_x}{v_x} = -\\gamma dt$$\n\nWe integrate from $v_{0,x}$ to $v_x$ and from $0$ to $t$:\n\n$$\\int_{v_{0,x}}^{v_x} \\frac{dv_x}{v_x} = -\\gamma \\int_{0}^{t} dt$$\n\n$$\\ln(v_x) - \\ln(v_{0,x}) = -\\gamma t$$\n\n$$v_x(t) = v_{0,x} e^{-\\gamma t}$$\n\nWe see an exponential decay in the velocity in the $x$ direction.\n\n#### Velocity in the $y$ direction\n\nNow we can try to do the same for $v_y$:\n\n$$\\dot{v}_y = -\\gamma v_y - g$$\n\nWe separate the variables and integrate:\n\n$$\\frac{dv_y}{v_y + \\frac{g}{\\gamma}} = -\\gamma dt$$\n\nNote that this integral will be of the form:\n\n$$\\int \\frac{dx}{x + a} = \\ln(x + a) + C$$\n\nAgain, we integrate from $v_{0,y}$ to $v_y$ and from $0$ to $t$:\n\n$$\\int_{v_{0,y}}^{v_y} \\frac{dv_y}{v_y + \\frac{g}{\\gamma}} = -\\gamma \\int_{0}^{t} dt$$\n\n$$\\ln(v_y + \\frac{g}{\\gamma}) - \\ln(v_{0,y} + \\frac{g}{\\gamma}) = -\\gamma t$$\n\n$$ln\\left(\\dfrac{v_y + \\frac{g}{\\gamma}}{v_{0,y} + \\frac{g}{\\gamma}}\\right) = -\\gamma t$$\n\nNext we use exponentiation and do a little algebra to solve for $v_y$:\n\n$$\\left(\\dfrac{g}{\\gamma} + v_y\\right) = \\left(\\dfrac{g}{\\gamma} + v_{0,y}\\right) e^{-\\gamma t}$$\n\n$$v_y(t) = \\dfrac{g}{\\gamma}\\left(e^{-\\gamma t} - 1\\right) + v_{0,y} e^{-\\gamma t}$$\n\nIn the $y$ direction, the story appears more complex.\n\n### Trajectories\n\nOne of the main concepts we will discuss the trajectory of a system. We borrow that language and idea from projectile motion --  the location of the particle as a function of time is the trajectory. In this class, we will consider the word trajectory to mean the evolution of any property of the system as a function of time. This connects strongly to the concept of phase space, which we will discuss in the future.\n\nIn the prior example, we found the trajectory of the velocity in the $x$ and $y$ directions. \n\n$$v_x(t) = v_{0,x} e^{-\\gamma t}$$\n$$v_y(t) = \\dfrac{g}{\\gamma}\\left(e^{-\\gamma t} - 1\\right) + v_{0,y} e^{-\\gamma t}$$\n\nWe can expound on that work to find the trajectory of the position of the particle as a function of time. We can integrate the velocity to get the position.\n\nThose integrals are doable, but they can be a little messy. We won't do them here, but quote the results consistent with the above equations.\n\n$$x(t) = x_0 + \\dfrac{1}{\\gamma}v_{0,x}\\left(1 - e^{-\\gamma t}\\right)$$\n$$y(t) = y_0 - \\dfrac{g}{\\gamma}t + \\dfrac{1}{\\gamma}\\left(\\dfrac{g}{\\gamma} + v_{0,y}\\right)\\left(1 - e^{-\\gamma t}\\right)$$\n\n## 2D Gravitational Bound System\n\nConsider a massive object (a large star) and a smaller satellite (a moon or small planet). We know that [Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation) tells us the force between two objects that interact gravitationally is:\n\n$$F = \\dfrac{G m_1 m_2}{r^2}$$\n\nwhere $G$ is the gravitational constant, $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the objects, and $r$ is the distance between the objects.\n\nBut we need to be more clear about the forces and the vector relationships. Consider the figure below with the massive object at the origin and the satellite at some distance $r$ from the origin. What is the vector $\\vec{r}$ that describes the location of the satellite?\n\n![Gravitational Bound System](../images/notes/week4/grav_01.png)\n\nIf we move the sun from the origin a little, we can start to see what $\\vec{r}$ is. The vector $\\vec{r}$ is the vector from the sun to the satellite. See the figure below to see the sketch.\n\n![Gravitational Bound System](../images/notes/week4/grav_02.png)\n\nSo if the location of the sun is $\\vec{r}_{sun}$ and the Earth is $\\vec{r}_{earth}$, then the vector $\\vec{r}$ is:\n\n$$\\vec{r} = \\vec{r}_{earth} - \\vec{r}_{sun}$$\n\nLet's return to the simplified model with the sun at the origin, and consider the earth at some distance $r$ from the origin. The force on the earth is:\n\n$$\\vec{F}_{grav} = -G \\dfrac{M_{sun} M_{earth}}{|\\vec{r}|^3} \\vec{r}$$\n\nwhere $M_{sun} = 2\\times10^{30} \\mathrm{kg}$ is the mass of the sun and $M_{earth} = 6 \\times 10^{24} \\mathrm{kg}$ is the mass of the earth. \n\n### Define the Coordinate System\n\nIn the figure below, we show the earth at some distance $r$ from the origin at an angle $\\phi$ from the $x$-axis. This distance is about $1.5 \\times 10^{11}\\;\\mathrm{m}$ or $1\\;\\mathrm{A.U.}$ ([astronomical unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit)). While not entirely obvious, the scale of these numbers allow us to assume the Sun is at the origin, and doesn't move. Although this is not a good assumption for the real solar system, the sun orbits the [barycenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycenter) of the solar system, which is about 1 solar radii from the center of the sun.\n\n![Gravitational Bound System](../images/notes/week4/grav_03.png)\n\nLet's use the standard $x$ and $y$ axes to write the equations of motion. We can apply Newton's Second Law to the earth in the chosen coordinate system. \n\n$$\\vec{F}_{net} = \\vec{F}_{gravity} = m\\vec{a} = m\\langle a_x, a_y \\rangle$$ \n\nSo that the forces in the $x$ and $y$ directions are:\n\n$$F_x = -G \\dfrac{M_{sun} M_{earth}x}{(x+2+y^2)^{3/2}} \\qquad F_y = -G \\dfrac{M_{sun} M_{earth}y}{(x+2+y^2)^{3/2}}$$\n\nand thus the acceleration of the Earth in the $x$ and $y$ directions are:\n\n$$a_x = -G \\dfrac{M_{sun} x}{(x+2+y^2)^{3/2}} \\qquad a_y = -G \\dfrac{M_{sun} y}{(x+2+y^2)^{3/2}}$$\n\nThis gives us a set of coupled differential equations.\n\n$$\\ddot{x} = -G \\dfrac{M_{sun} x}{(x+2+y^2)^{3/2}} \\qquad \\ddot{y} = -G \\dfrac{M_{sun} y}{(x+2+y^2)^{3/2}}$$\n\n### How do we then get the trajectories?\n\nWe can't solve these equations without more information. We need to know the initial conditions of the system (the initial position and velocity of the Earth). We can then integrate these equations to get the position of the Earth as a function of time.\n\nWe have three potential ways to solve these EOMs:\n\n1) Direct Integration: We can integrate the equations of motion directly. This is possible in some cases where the equations are simple enough; think about the falling ball without air resistance, or the linear 1D drag case.\n2) Decouple and Solve: We try to solve the coupled differential equations by decoupling them. This is possible in some cases, but not all. We can frequently decouple the equations by writing them in terms of the velocity, or by making a change of position variables.\n3) Numerical Integration: We use numerical methods to predict the motion in small time steps. This is the most common method for solving complex systems.\n\n\n\n## The Simple Harmonic Oscillator (SHO)\n\nIn 1D, the simple harmonic oscillator is a system where the force is proportional to the displacement from the equilibrium position. The force is given by:\n\n$$F = -ks$$\n\nwhere $k$ is the spring constant and $s$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position, $x-L_0$. The quantity $L_0$ is the relaxed length of the spring. The figure below shows the typical horizontal spring system.\n\n![SHO](../images/notes/week3/sho_horizontal.png)\n\nWe can typically choose to measure the displacement from the equilibrium position, and write the force instead as:\n\n$$F = m a_x = m \\dot{v}_x  = m\\ddot{x} = -kx$$\n\nSo the equation of motion that we will try to solve is:\n\n$$\\ddot{x} = -\\dfrac{k}{m}x$$\n\n### How do we solve this?\n\n$$\\dfrac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -\\dfrac{k}{m}x = - \\omega^2 x$$\n\nwhere $\\omega = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{k}{m}}$ is the natural oscillation frequency of the system. \n\nIt might seem strange, but let's try the following potential solution to the differential equation:\n\n$$x(t) = C e^{i\\omega t}$$\n\nwhere $C$ is a constant. We can take the second derivative of $x(t)$ with respect to time to see if it satisfies the differential equation.\n\n$$\\dot{x}(t) = i\\omega C e^{i\\omega t}$$\n$$\\ddot{x}(t) = -\\omega^2 C e^{i\\omega t} = -\\omega^2 x(t)$$\n\nThis is a solution to the differential equation as long as $C$ is a constant, but it's a complex one ($C=a+ib$). We can also write the solution in terms of the cosine and sine functions because the exponential function can be written in terms of these functions.\n\n$$e^{i\\omega t} = \\cos(\\omega t) + i\\sin(\\omega t)$$\n\nThus, another general solution to this EOM that we can write is:\n\n$$x(t) = A \\cos(\\omega t) + B \\sin(\\omega t)$$\n\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants that depend on the initial conditions of the system. Let's see how that works:\n\n$$\\dot{x}(t) = -A \\omega \\sin(\\omega t) + B \\omega \\cos(\\omega t)$$\n$$\\ddot{x}(t) = -A \\omega^2 \\cos(\\omega t) - B \\omega^2 \\sin(\\omega t) = -\\omega^2 x(t)$$\n\nAnother form that works is:\n\n$$x(t) = D \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)$$\n\nwhere $D$ is the amplitude of the oscillation and $\\phi$ is the phase of the oscillation.  Let's check that again:\n\n$$\\dot{x}(t) = -D \\omega \\sin(\\omega t + \\phi)$$\n$$\\ddot{x}(t) = -D \\omega^2 \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi) = -\\omega^2 x(t)$$\n\nSo we have several forms of the general solution to the simple harmonic oscillator. We can use these solutions to understand the behavior of the system. We can also use these solutions to understand the behavior of more complex systems that can be approximated by the simple harmonic oscillator. \n\nOne critical aspect of these solutions is that they have 2 free parameters, $A$ and $B$, or $D$ and $\\phi$. These parameters are determined by the initial conditions of the system. **There are N free parameters in the general solution to an Nth order differential equation.**\n\n\n"

        "# Week 5 - Conservation Laws\n\n\n\nWe started with Newton's Laws of Motion because they provide a framework for us to develop the equations of motion. However, there is a broader framework that can help us understand and organize our knowledge of physics. These are [conservation laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_law).\n\nConservation laws are principles that state that certain properties of a system remain constant over time. These properties are called conserved quantities. In classical mechanics, there are three main conservation laws:\n\n1. **Conservation of Energy**: The total energy of an isolated system remains constant over time.\n2. **Conservation of Momentum**: The total momentum of an isolated system remains constant over time.\n3. **Conservation of Angular Momentum**: The total angular momentum of an isolated system remains constant over time.\n\nWe will discuss them briefly below, before we dive into the details of conservation of energy. The concept of energy is so important and complimentary to our understanding of motion that we will focus on it before returning to momentum and angular momentum.\n\n## Conservation of Energy\n\n[Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy) is a central concept of science. It is also a very challenging conceptual idea. Physicists are known to say things like, \n\n> *\"I can't tell you what energy is, but I can tell you how to calculate it.\"*\n\nRichard Feynman is known to have had a disdain for the wildly different units of energy that we use in physics.\n\n### Feynman on the units of energy (2 minute video)\n\n[![Feynman on the units of energy](../images/notes/week5/roX2NXDUTsM.jpg)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=roX2NXDUTsM)\n\nFeynman is quoted as saying: \n> *\"It is important to realize that in physics today, we have no knowledge of what energy is.\"*\n\nEnergy is a number, a quantity, that when we compute it, we find it stays the same before and after a process - so long as we account for all the interactions and uses in that case. \n\nConservation of energy states that there is not temporal change in the total energy of a system. This is a very powerful idea, but it is not always easy to apply.\n\n$$\\dfrac{dE}{dt} = 0$$\n\nIf this equation holds between any two states of a system, we say that energy is conserved. A simpler statement is thus,\n\n$$E_{before} = E_{after}$$\n\n## Energy is a challenging concept\n\nTo frame how interesting and complex energy can be, consider this video from Veritasium:\n\n### How do we get light from a circuit when we close a switch? (14 minute video)\n\n[![The Big Misconception About Electricity](../images/notes/week5/bHIhgxav9LY.jpg)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=bHIhgxav9LY)\n\nThere a many potential forms of energy and lots of processes that convert energy from one form to another. Below is a table of some common forms in physics. In addition, we have listed subsets of these forms that are often useful to distinguish. We will do analyses that include most of these forms.\n\n| **Main Form of Energy** | **Narrower Distinction** | **Description**                                     |\n|---------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n|   Kinetic Energy    |                      | Energy of macroscopic motion                    |\n|                     | Translational        | Energy due to point particle translation        |\n|                     | Rotational           | Energy due to rotation                          |\n|                     | Vibrational          | Energy due to vibration                         |\n|   Potential Energy  |                      | Energy due to position                          |\n|                     | Gravitational        | Energy due to position in a gravitational field |\n|                     | Elastic              | Energy due to deformation of an elastic object  |\n|                     | Electric             | Energy due to position in an electric field     |\n|   Internal Energy   |                      | Energy due to microscopic motion                |\n\n\n\n\n\n## The Point Particle\n\nCritical to the understanding of energy is that it is a property of a system. A system can consist of a single object or be made of many different objects. In the case of modeling the motion of a single object, we often introduce the concept of a [point mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_mass) or [point particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_particle). A point mass is an idealized object that has mass but no size or shape. It has no internal structure and thus no internal energy. It is a useful abstraction for modeling the motion of objects in classical mechanics.\n\n### Point Particle and Real Models (6 minute video)\n\nThe video below is from an introductory physics course at Georgia Tech. It covers the important aspects of a point particle and how we miss some of the details when we focus exclusively on the point particle model.\n\n[![Point Particle and Real Models](../images/notes/week5/fbiNKrqVajM.jpg))](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbiNKrqVajM)\n\n### Kinetic Energy of a Point Mass\n\nIn that case of a point particle, we often focus on the kinetic energy of the object. The classical kinetic energy of a point mass is given by the equation:\n\n$$K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$$\n\nwhere $m$ is the mass of the object and $v$ is its velocity. The kinetic energy of a point mass is a scalar quantity, which as we will learn is much easier to work with than a vector quantity. \n\nHowever, we can loose some information by moving to an energy-only framework; we typically focus on the behavior before and after a process and not the details of the process itself when using energy conservation. \n\n### Work \n\nWork is a concept closely related to energy, it describes the transfer of energy from one system to another. Our definition of work is macroscopic and thus will not related to temperature. Increases in temperature are related to internal energy, and thus the micrscopic motion of the particles in a system. As we consider a point particle moving from one location to another under a given force, we can define the work done by that force as:\n\n$$W = \\int_{x_i}^{x_f} F(x) dx$$\n\nwhere $F(x)$ is the one-dimensional force acting on the particle between locations $x_i$ and $x_f$. More generally, if there is a position dependent force, we can write the work done by that force as:\n\n$$W = \\int_{C} \\vec{F} \\cdot d\\vec{l}$$\n\nwhere $C$ is the path taken by the particle and $d\\vec{l}$ is a differential displacement vector along that path. \n\n### Work-Energy Theorem\n\nThe work-energy theorem show the relationship between work and the change in kinetic energy of a point mass. The work done on a point mass is equal to the change in its kinetic energy:\n\n$$W = \\Delta K = K_f - K_i$$\n\n## Conservation of Momentum and Angular Momentum\n\n[Linear Momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum) is a vector quantity that describes the motion of an object. It is defined as the product of an object's mass and its velocity:\n\n$$\\vec{p} = m\\vec{v}$$\n\n[Angular Momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum) is a vector quantity that describes the rotational motion of an object. It is defined as the cross product of the position vector and the momentum vector:\n\n$$\\vec{L} = \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{p}$$\n\nThese two other conservation laws are vector conservation laws. That is, they hold in each direction. Much like the definition of conservation of energy, we can start with the time derivatives of both momentum and angular momentum.\n\n$$\\dfrac{d\\vec{p}}{dt} = 0$$\n\n$$\\dfrac{d\\vec{L}}{dt} = 0$$\n\nAs before, we can take small steps in time and write the change in momentum and angular momentum as:\n\n$$\\Delta \\vec{p} = 0 $$\n\n$$\\Delta \\vec{L} = 0$$\n\nAnd thus, we see that each component is conserved. For momentum,\n\n$$\\langle \\Delta p_x, \\Delta p_y, \\Delta p_z \\rangle = 0$$\n\n$$\\Delta p_x = 0 \\qquad \\Delta p_y = 0 \\qquad \\Delta p_z = 0$$\n\n$$p_{x,i} = p_{x,f} \\qquad p_{y,i} = p_{y,f} \\qquad p_{z,i} = p_{z,f}$$\n\nIf the linear momentum is conserved in each direction, then the total linear momentum is conserved. The linear momentum will be the same before and after a process. For angular momentum, we find,\n\n$$\\langle \\Delta L_x, \\Delta L_y, \\Delta L_z \\rangle = 0$$\n\n$$\\Delta L_x = 0 \\qquad \\Delta L_y = 0 \\qquad \\Delta L_z = 0$$\n\n$$L_{x,i} = L_{x,f} \\qquad L_{y,i} = L_{y,f} \\qquad L_{z,i} = L_{z,f}$$\n\nIf the angular momentum is conserved in each direction, then the total angular momentum is conserved. The angular momentum will be the same before and after a process.\n\nAfter we get a handle on energy, we will return to momentum and angular momentum.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "# Week 5 - Notes: Conservation of Energy\n\nOne expression of a conservation law is the [conservation of energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy). For an isolated and closed system, the total energy is conserved. That is, before and after any process, we can account for all the energy in the system and it is the same. More generally, conservation of energy accounts for the energy \"lost\" to the surroundings. All of the changes to the system must be accounted for in changes the surroundings. \n\nFor a given choice of system that interacts with its surroundings, the change in energy of the system is equal to the work done on the system and any heat exchanged with the surroundings. This is a statement of the [first law of thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_law_of_thermodynamics). We can write that statement mathematically as:\n\n$$\\Delta E_{\\text{system}} = W + Q$$\n\n\nwhere $\\Delta E_{\\text{system}}$ is the change in energy of the system, $W$ is the work done on the system, and $Q$ is the heat exchanged with the surroundings.\n\n:::{admonition} Sign conventions\n:class: warning\n\nNote that the signs of the work done and heat exchanged are important. But we can remember them by asking if the system is going to increase its energy. \n\nIf we add energy into the system by heating it, then $Q$ is positive because $\\Delta E_{\\text{system}}$ is positive. If the remove energy from the system through an exchange of heat, then $Q$ is negative.\n\nIf the system does work on the surroundings, for example, by exerting a force on an external object over some displacement, then $W$ is negative because $\\Delta E_{\\text{system}}$ is negative. If instead the surroundings do work on the system, then $W$ is positive.\n\n:::\n\nWe can rewrite this energy equation as an update equation for the energy of the system:\n\n$$E_{\\text{system,f}} = E_{\\text{system,i}} + W + Q$$\n\nFrom this equation, we can see that the final state of the system's energy is determined by the sum of its initial energy, the work done on the system, and the heat exchanged with the surroundings.\n\n## The Work-Energy Theorem\n\nWe often model a system as a single object that interacts with its surroundings. In this case, it's often beneficial to select the object alone to be the system of interest. Then all of our work is to explain and predict the dynamics of the object.\n\nThis simplification allows us to employ a more specialized case of the general energy equation. We can write the work-energy theorem as:\n\n$$\\Delta E_{\\text{object}} = W_{\\text{net}}$$\nwhere $\\Delta E_{\\text{object}}$ is the change in energy of the object and $W_{\\text{net}}$ is the net work done on the object.\n\nMore specifically, we often focus only on the changes to the object's motion. This is because we use often use the model of a [point particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_particle) to describe the object. In this case, the object has no internal structure and thus no internal energy. The only energy we need to consider is the object's kinetic energy, $K$. \n\n:::{admonition} Limitation of this model\n\nThe point particle model where we focus on the kinetic energy of an object is an obvious simplification. But it might not be so obvious how quickly it is to break down.\n\nConsider pushing a block across the floor. The block is a point particle and we model it as such. It comes to a stop and we argue the block's kinetic energy was converted to heat in the floor. \n\nBut what about the block itself? Would it's surface temperature increase? It does, but we don't account for it.\n\nA great account of these kinds of situations is from my colleague [Bruce Sherwood](https:/brucesherwood.net/).  Bruce's paper, [*Pseudowork and real work*, American Journal of Physics (1982)](https://pubs.aip.org/aapt/ajp/article-abstract/51/7/597/1052185/Pseudowork-and-real-work?redirectedFrom=fulltext), is an important read about the limitation of the point particle model. You can find a PDF copy [here](https://brucesherwood.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Pseudowork1983.pdf).\n:::\n\n### Kinetic Energy\n\nOur model of [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy) stems from a [series of experiments dropping stones into clay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willem_%27s_Gravesande). The depth of the hole made was proportional to the square of the impact speed.\n\nThrough many additional experiments we have quantified the kinetic energy of a point particle as:\n\n$$K = \\frac{1}{2}m\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{v}.$$\n\nWe also use $T$ to represent kinetic energy, so you might see it written as:\n\n$$T = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2.$$\n\nNote that this description of the kinetic energy is fully classical. It is the energy of motion in the limit that object moves much slower than the speed of light. We learned from [Einstein's special theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_theory_of_relativity) that the total energy of an point particle is:\n\n$$E_{tot} = \\gamma mc^2,$$\n\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the [Lorentz factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_factor) and $c$ is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor is defined as:\n\n$$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}.$$\n\nNotice that if $v/c =0$ then,\n\n$$\\gamma = 1 \\longrightarrow E_{tot} = mc^2.$$\n\nWe call this the \"rest energy\" of the object. It is the energy of the object when it is not moving, and it demonstrates the [mass-energy equivalence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass%E2%80%93energy_equivalence).\n\n$$E_{rest} = mc^2.$$\n\nThe remaining energy of the object is the kinetic energy, $T$. We can write that as:\n\n$$T = E_{tot} - E_{rest} = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2.$$\n\nWe can take the limit that $v/c \\ll 1$ and expand the Lorentz factor in a Taylor series to find that:\n\n$$\\gamma = 1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{v^2}{c^2} + \\ldots.$$\n\nThen we find that the kinetic energy is:\n\n$$T = \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{v^2}{c^2} + \\ldots - 1\\right)mc^2 = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \\ldots.$$\n\nWe have recovered the classical expression for kinetic energy. The higher order terms in the expansion are negligible when $v/c \\ll 1$.\n\n## Developing the Work-Energy Theorem\n\nLet's start with our definition of the classical kinetic energy of a point particle:\n\n$$T = \\frac{1}{2}m\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{v}.$$\n\nWe ask how does $T$ change with time? We take the time derivative of $T$:\n\n$$\\dfrac{dT}{dt} = \\frac{1}{2}m\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{v}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}m\\left(\\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt}\\cdot\\vec{v} + \\vec{v}\\cdot\\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt}\\right).$$\n\nThe last term can be combined because the dot product is commutative. We can factor out the $m/2$ and write:\n\n$$\\dfrac{dT}{dt} = \\dfrac{m}{2}\\left(2 \\dfrac{d\\vec{v}}{dt}\\cdot\\vec{v}\\right) = m\\left(\\dfrac{d\\vec{v}}{dt}\\cdot\\vec{v}\\right).$$\n\nOk, in that expression is the net force on the object,\n\n$$\\vec{F}_{net} = m\\dfrac{d\\vec{v}}{dt}.$$\n\nSo that,\n\n$$\\dfrac{dT}{dt} = \\vec{F}_{net}\\cdot\\vec{v}.$$\n\nNow let's discretize the time derivative to make sense of this.\n\n$$\\dfrac{\\Delta T}{\\Delta t} = \\vec{F}_{net}\\cdot\\vec{v}.$$\n\n$$\\Delta T = \\vec{F}_{net}\\cdot\\vec{v}\\Delta t.$$\n\nThat last term is the displacement of the object, $\\Delta \\vec{x} = \\vec{v}\\Delta t$. So we can write:\n\n$$\\Delta T = \\vec{F}_{net}\\cdot\\Delta \\vec{x}.$$\n\nThis is the work done on the object by the net force. We can write that as:\n\n$$\\Delta T = W_{\\text{net}}.$$\n\n### Overall Effect of the Forces\n\nConsider that we are looking at the changes in the object's motion over a longer period of space and time. This discrete model above helps us understand the relationship between the work done on the object and the change in its kinetic energy in a small interval, but what about the overall effect of the forces on the object?\n\nConsider a discrete set of $n$ spatial intervals, $\\Delta x_i$, where $i$ is the index of the interval. \n\n$$x = {x_0, x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n}$$\n\nAt each of these spatial intervals, we experience a different net force, like in the figure below.\n\n![Work done by a net force](../images/notes/week5/discrete-force-intervals.png)\n\n$$F_{net} = {F_{net,0}, F_{net,1}, F_{net,2}, \\ldots, F_{net,n}}$$\n\nThe work done by this force is the change in kinetic energy of the object:\n\n$$W_{\\text{net}} = \\sum_{i=0}^{n} F_{net,i}\\Delta x_i = \\Delta T.$$\n\n$$W_{\\text{net}} = K_f - K_i.$$\n\n$$W_{\\text{net}} = \\dfrac{1}{2}m\\vec{v}_f\\cdot\\vec{v}_f - \\dfrac{1}{2}m\\vec{v}_i\\cdot\\vec{v}_i.$$\n\nNotice that in the limit that $n \\rightarrow \\infty$ and $\\Delta x_i \\rightarrow 0$, we have a continuous function of the net force. We can write that as:\n\n$$\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\sum_{i=0}^{n} F_{net,i}\\Delta x_i = \\int_{x_i}^{x_f} F_{net}(x)dx.$$\n\nThus, in our continuous limit, we can write the work done by the net force as:\n\n$$\\Delta T = W_{\\text{net}} = \\int_{x_i}^{x_f} F_{net}(x)dx.$$\n\nWhat about in more than one dimension?\n\n### Work done in more than one dimension\n\nConsider a path $C$ that we have discretized into $n$ intervals. The object starts at $\\vec{r}_0$ and ends at $\\vec{r}_n$. Each interval is $\\Delta \\vec{r}_i$ and the net force is $\\vec{F}_{net,i}$. The figure below shows the work done by the net force in each interval.\n\n![Work done by a net force](../images/notes/week5/path-integral-work.png)\n\n\nThe work done by the net force is:\n\n$$W_{\\text{net}} = \\sum_{i=0}^{n} \\vec{F}_{net,i}\\cdot\\Delta \\vec{r}_i.$$\n\nas $\\Delta \\vec{r}_i \\rightarrow 0$ and $n \\rightarrow \\infty$, we have a continuous function of the net force. We can write that as:\n\n$$W_{\\text{net}} = \\int_{C} \\vec{F}_{net}\\cdot d\\vec{r}.$$\n\nThe work can be positive, if the force and displacement are in the same direction, or negative, if they are in opposite directions. It can also be zero, if the force is perpendicular to the displacement.\n\nIf the force is **always** perpendicular to the displacement, then the work done by the force is zero. This is because the dot product of two perpendicular vectors is zero. But what kind of motion is possible?\n\n## Example: The Simple Harmonic Oscillator\n\nConsider, again, the humble [SHO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_oscillator). If we have a horizontal spring mass system, we know we can write the force on the mass as:\n\n$$F_s = -kx.$$\n\nLet's allow the spring to move from $x_i$ to $x_f$, while the speed changes from $v_i$ to $v_f$. \n\nThe change in kinetic energy is:\n\n$$\\Delta T = \\dfrac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - \\dfrac{1}{2}mv_i^2.$$\n\nThe work done by the spring is:\n\n$$W_s = \\int_{x_i}^{x_f} F_s dx = -\\int_{x_i}^{x_f} kx dx = -\\left[\\dfrac{1}{2}kx^2\\right]_{x_i}^{x_f} = -\\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}kx_f^2 - \\dfrac{1}{2}kx_i^2\\right).$$\n\nOr more simply,\n\n$$W_s = \\dfrac{1}{2}k(x_i^2 - x_f^2).$$\n\nThe Work-Energy Theorem tells us that:\n\n$$\\Delta T = W_s.$$\n\n$$\\dfrac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - \\dfrac{1}{2}mv_i^2 = \\dfrac{1}{2}k(x_i^2 - x_f^2).$$\n\nWe can rearrange this to find the relationship between the states before and after the motion:\n\n$$\\dfrac{1}{2}mv_f^2 + \\dfrac{1}{2}k x_f^2 = \\dfrac{1}{2}mv_i^2 + \\dfrac{1}{2}k x_i^2.$$\n\nThe first term on the left and right side are the energy due to motion. The second terms are some other energy, but taken together before and after the motion, they are the same. They are a constant. **This is a [conserved quantity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass%E2%80%93energy_equivalence#Conservation_of_mass_and_energy).** \n\nWe call the second quantity the **potential energy** of the spring-mass system. It is the energy of the system due to its position, or it's \"configuration\". We define the potential energy of the spring as:\n\n$$U_s = \\dfrac{1}{2}kx^2.$$\n\nWe often use $V$ to represent potential energy, so you might see it written as:\n\n$$V_s = \\dfrac{1}{2}kx^2.$$\n\nWhat we have discovered is that the total energy of the spring-mass system is:\n\n$$E_{tot} = T + U_s = \\dfrac{1}{2}mv^2 + \\dfrac{1}{2}kx^2 = \\text{constant}.$$\n\nYou have likely seen this previously in your study of the SHO. It is a very important result. But it is also the case that we don't always have a potential energy function.\n\nWe need to have a [conservative force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_force) to have a potential energy function. A conservative force is one where the work done by the force is independent of the path taken. Above, we assumed that in our calculations because the force was only dependent on the position of the object. That is a key feature of a conservative force.\n\n\n\n## Example: A Lattice Chain\n\nA less obivous example that produces a potential energy function is a [lattice chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_chain). Here we model an electron moving in 1D near but not too near a long chain of atoms. The picture below shows the model.\n\n![Lattice chain model](../images/notes/week5/lattice-chain.png)\n\nHere the location of the particle and it's initial velocty are zero. The force model for a chain of atoms in this arrangement is:\n\n$$F(x) = -F_0 \\sin \\left(\\dfrac{2\\pi x}{b}\\right)$$\n\nwhere $b$ is the spacing between the atoms and $F_0$ is a constant.\n\nWe can again find the kinetic energy change and work done by the force:\n\n$$\\Delta T = \\dfrac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - \\dfrac{1}{2}mv_i^2 = \\dfrac{1}{2}mv_f^2.$$\n\n$$W = \\int_{0}^{x_f} F(x) dx = -F_0 \\int_{0}^{x_f} \\sin \\left(\\dfrac{2\\pi x}{b}\\right) dx = -\\left[-\\dfrac{b}{2\\pi}F_0 \\cos \\left(\\dfrac{2\\pi x}{b}\\right)\\right]_{0}^{x_f}$$\n\n$$ = \\dfrac{b}{2\\pi}F_0 \\left(\\cos \\left(\\dfrac{2\\pi x_f}{b}\\right) - \\cos \\left(0\\right)\\right).$$\n\nUsing the Work-Energy Theorem, we can write:\n\n$$\\dfrac{1}{2}mv_f^2 = \\dfrac{b}{2\\pi}F_0 \\left(\\cos \\left(\\dfrac{2\\pi x_f}{b}\\right) - 1\\right).$$\n\nThus, we can find the speed of the object at a given position:\n\n$$v_f(x) = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{b}{\\pi m}F_0 \\left(\\cos \\left(\\dfrac{2\\pi x_f}{b}\\right) - 1\\right)}.$$\n\nBut more importantly, we can derive a potential energy function for the lattice chain. We can write:\n\n$$U(x) = -\\int F(x) dx = \\dfrac{b}{2\\pi}F_0 \\cos \\left(\\dfrac{2\\pi x}{b}\\right) + C.$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant. We can choose $C$ so that $U(0) = 0$; only the difference in potential energy matter. Then we have:\n\n$$U(x) = \\dfrac{b}{2\\pi}F_0 \\cos \\left(\\dfrac{2\\pi x}{b}\\right).$$\n\nThis is just **another** conservative force.\n\n## Conservative Forces\n\nThese forces occur frequently enough in physics and their properties are so important that they deserve their own attention. There are a few key properties of conservative forces that we should note:\n\n1. if the work is independent of the path taken, then the force is conservative.\n2. if the work done by the force is zero for a closed path, then the force is conservative.\n3. if the curl of the force is zero, then the force is conservative.\n\nIt turns out that all of these statements are equivalent. And if any one of them is true, the rest hold, and we can develop a potential energy function for the force.\n\n### Why do these imply each other?\n\nLet's start with the curl of the force. The [curl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curl) of a vector field is a measure of the rotation of the field. It is a [vector differential operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus_operator). Operationally, taking the curl amounts to a cross product of the del operator with the vector field. The curl of a vector field $\\vec{F}$ is defined as:\n\n$$\\nabla \\times \\vec{F} = \\begin{vmatrix}\\hat{i} & \\hat{j} & \\hat{k} \\\\ \\partial_x & \\partial_y & \\partial_z \\\\ F_x & F_y & F_z \\end{vmatrix} = \\left(\\dfrac{\\partial F_z}{\\partial y} - \\dfrac{\\partial F_y}{\\partial z}\\right)\\hat{i} + \\left(\\dfrac{\\partial F_x}{\\partial z} - \\dfrac{\\partial F_z}{\\partial x}\\right)\\hat{j} + \\left(\\dfrac{\\partial F_y}{\\partial x} - \\dfrac{\\partial F_x}{\\partial y}\\right)\\hat{k}.$$\n\nIn the event that the curl vanishes, we know that each term in the curl is zero. In this case, we can investigate what this implies about other aspects of the force. We write [Stokes' theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes%27_theorem) for the force as:\n\n$$\\iint_S (\\nabla \\times \\vec{F})\\cdot d\\vec{S} = \\oint_C \\vec{F}\\cdot d\\vec{r}.$$\n\nThe left hand side is the integral of the curl of the force over some surface $S$ with boundary $C$. The right hand side is the line integral of the force around the boundary of the surface.  This theorem holds for any vector field with continuous first derivatives, so most of what we do.\n\nStokes's theorem tells us that for any choice of surface $S$ with boundary $C$, the line integral of the force around the boundary is equal to the integral of the curl of the force over the surface. If the curl vanishes, then the integral of the curl is zero. Thus, the line integral of the force around the boundary is zero.\n\n$$\\oint_C \\vec{F}\\cdot d\\vec{r} = 0.$$\n\nThis is true for any closed path $C$. This is the second statement above.\n\nWe can equivalent write the integral of the force around a closed path as the work around a different path. The figure below shows these paths $C_1$ and $C_2$ that make up the first loop, and the paths $C_3$ and $C_4$ that make up the second loop. The work done by the force along each path is shown in the figure.\n\n![Work done by a net force](../images/notes/week5/closed-path-work.png)\n\nWe can take the integral of both paths and write:\n\n$$\\oint_C \\vec{F}\\cdot d\\vec{r} = \\int_{C_1} \\vec{F}\\cdot d\\vec{r} + \\int_{C_2} \\vec{F}\\cdot d\\vec{r} = \\int_{C_3} \\vec{F}\\cdot d\\vec{r} + \\int_{C_4} \\vec{F}\\cdot d\\vec{r} = 0.$$\n\nBecause both paths are closed and start and return to the same point, we can know that each contribution on each part of the path is equal and opposite. Thus, we can write:\n\n$$\\int_{C_n} \\vec{F}\\cdot d\\vec{r} = -\\int_{C_m} \\vec{F}\\cdot d\\vec{r}.$$\n\nThis holds for any $n$ and $m$ where they make a closed path $C$. This is the first statement above.\n\n## Summary of Results\n\nWe covered a lot fo ground. Let's remind ourselves of the key results.\n\nThe total energy of a system is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies:\n\n$$E = T + V = K +U.$$\n\nWe use both $T$ and $K$ to represent kinetic energy, and both $U$ and $V$ to represent potential energy.\n\nThe conservation of energy is:\n\n$$\\dfrac{dE}{dt} = 0.$$\n\nWhen all the forces are conservative, energy is conserved. Of course, we are limiting here to mechanical energy.\n\nConservative forces are those where the work done by the force is independent of the path taken. They have several key properties:\n\n1. The forces are functions of position only $\\vec{F}(\\vec{r})$.\n2. Their curl is zero: $\\nabla \\times \\vec{F} = 0$.\n\nWe calculate the curl as:\n$$\\nabla \\times \\vec{F} = \\begin{vmatrix}\\hat{i} & \\hat{j} & \\hat{k} \\\\ \\partial_x & \\partial_y & \\partial_z \\\\ F_x & F_y & F_z \\end{vmatrix} = \\left(\\dfrac{\\partial F_z}{\\partial y} - \\dfrac{\\partial F_y}{\\partial z}\\right)\\hat{i} + \\left(\\dfrac{\\partial F_x}{\\partial z} - \\dfrac{\\partial F_z}{\\partial x}\\right)\\hat{j} + \\left(\\dfrac{\\partial F_y}{\\partial x} - \\dfrac{\\partial F_x}{\\partial y}\\right)\\hat{k}.$$\n\n3. The force is given by the negative gradient of the potential energy: $\\vec{F} = -\\nabla U$. This stems from the definition of the potential energy as the work done by the force.\n\nWe can calculate the gradient as:\n\n$$\\vec{F} = \\langle F_x, F_y, F_z \\rangle = -\\nabla U = -\\left(\\dfrac{\\partial U}{\\partial x}\\hat{i} + \\dfrac{\\partial U}{\\partial y}\\hat{j} + \\dfrac{\\partial U}{\\partial z}\\hat{k}\\right).$$\n\n4. The work done by a conservative force is path independent. We can write the work done by a conservative force as:\n\n$$W = \\int_{C} \\vec{F}\\cdot d\\vec{r} = -\\int_{C} \\nabla U\\cdot d\\vec{r} = -\\Delta U.$$\n\n\n"

        "# Week 6 - Stability and Equilibria\n\nWe have shown that we can develop trajectories of different physical systems by solving the differential equations that describe them. This is a useful approach, but it often means we are focused on a single trajectory. This might be fine if all the trajectories are the same or roughly so, say like the 1D falling ball, or the simple harmonic oscillator. \n\nSystems can produce multiple families of trajectories depending on the parameter choices, and the initial conditions associated with the problem you are solving. A more general approach that starts us down the road of characterizing the many potential behaviors that a physical system can exhibit is to consider [stability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability_theory). As we will build the toolkit to investigate classical systems, understanding equilibrium points and their stability is a useful step. \n\n\n## Why do we study stability and equilibria?\n\nFirst, because nature is often moving towards a state of equilibrium because those states are associated, as we will see, with the lowest local energy state. It takes energy to move away from stable equilibrium, and physical systems tend to minimize their energy -- because those configurations are often quite stable. \n\nMuch of the physics that we do today focuses on [non-equilibrium systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-equilibrium_thermodynamics). These are systems that are typically driven by external interactions to ensure the system remains out of equilibrium. The responses of these systems to this driving and how they might relax to equilibrium are often studied.\n\nSecond, we can often start from the equilibrium points of a system and then perturb the system to see how it responds. We know how to solve problems around equilibrium points, and working with fully non-equilibrium systems is often much harder. \n\nWe have gotten much better at working in non-equilibrium spaces, especially as we have developed computing tools that can help us simulate the behavior of systems that are far from equilibrium.\n\n## The Simple Harmonic Oscillator Models Many Systems\n\nYou have used the simple harmonic oscillator frequently. \n\nThere's a reason for that. \n\nIt provides the simplest example of a system that exhibits periodic motion. It also is a system with one of the simplest energy landscapes -- a parabola; and it has a global stable equilibrium point at the bottom of the potential well.\n\nThere are many systems that we can transform into a simple harmonic oscillator. And it is not because the world is full of springs and masses. It is because the simple harmonic oscillator is a good model for many systems near their local equilibrium points. In fact, as you will see, it is the leading (non-constant) term in every Taylor expansion of a 1D potential energy function near a local minimum.\n\n### Another SHO Example - A Pendulum\n\nConsider a pendulum of mass $m$ and length $L$ that is displaced from the vertical by an angle $\\theta$. We can show that the complete equation of motion (without drag) is:\n\n$$mL\\ddot{\\theta} = - mg\\sin \\theta,$$\n\n$$\\ddot{\\theta} = -\\frac{g}{L}\\sin \\theta.$$\n\nTypically we limit to small angles, so $\\sin \\theta \\approx \\theta$, and the equation becomes: \n\n$$\\ddot{\\theta} = -\\frac{g}{L}\\theta.$$\n\nThis is a second order differential equation that we have solved before. The general EOM for a simple harmonic oscillator is:\n\n$$\\ddot{x} = -\\omega^2 x.$$\n\nA general solution to this equation is:\n\n$$x(t) = A\\cos(\\omega t + \\phi),$$\n\nwhere $A$ is the amplitude of the oscillation, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of the oscillation, and $\\phi$ is the phase of the oscillation.\n\nThis model of an SHO works with many systems, not just pendulums. Here's some examples along with the equivalent natural oscillation frequency, $\\omega^2$, for each system:\n\n| System | Equation of motion | $\\omega^2$ |\n|--------|--------------------|------------|\n| Mass-spring system | $m\\ddot{x} = -kx$ | $k/m$ |\n| Pendulum | $\\ddot{\\theta} = -\\frac{g}{L}\\theta$ | $g/L$ |\n| LC circuit | $L\\ddot{q} = -\\frac{q}{C}$ | $1/LC$ |\n| Water in a U-shaped tube | $\\ddot{h} = -\\frac{2g\\rho A}{M} h$| $\\frac{2g\\rho A}{M}$ |\n\n\n### Stability of the SHO\n\nRegardless of the choice of physical model, the SHO equation is the same second order differential equation, which we write in general as:\n\n$$\\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = -\\omega^2 x$$\n\nFor a given system, this results in a potential energy that is proportional to the square of the variable $x$ (the \"stretch\") and to the square of the frequency $\\omega$. This potential energy is always positive, and it can have a non-zero minimum.\n\n$$U(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\xi \\omega^2 x^2 + U_0$$\n\nwhere $\\xi$ is a positive constant (with units!) of proportionality. In the case of a mass on a spring, $\\xi = m$. We can find the equilibrium points by setting taking the first derivative of the potential energy and setting it to zero.\n\n$$\\frac{dU}{dx} = \\xi \\omega^2 x = 0$$\n\nThis gives us the equilibrium point at $x = 0$. We might have expected this, as the potential energy is a parabola, and the minimum of a parabola is at the vertex. We can also determine the stability of this equilibrium point by looking at the second derivative of the potential energy, and evaluating it at the equilibrium point.\n\n$$\\frac{d^2U}{dx^2} = \\xi \\omega^2 > 0$$\n\nThis number is always positive, indicating that for an SHO, the equilibrium point is stable. This is a general result for the SHO, and it is true for all the systems listed above.\n\n## Interpreting your Analysis\n\nAbove, we completed an analysis of the simplest system that we will work with. It lead us to find a global minimum in the potential energy, so that suggests a few things for us to think about:\n\n1. **The SHO is a conservative system - the total energy of the system is conserved.** So any trajectory will oscillate between kinetic and potential energy, but the total energy will remain constant. This is not something that will always be true.\n2. **The SHO has a global minimum in potential energy - a globally stable equilibrium point.** Oscillations will always occur around this point. Global stability is a very strong form of stability; it is also rare in that most systems have multiple equilibrium points: some are stable, some are not, and some are [metastable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastability).\n3. **If the SHO starts at rest at the equilibrium point, it will remain there.** It will take energy put into the system to move away from the equilibrium point. Because this a global minimum, all trajectories will oscillate around this point. However, in systems with local equilibrium points, the system can be perturbed away from the equilibrium point, and end up in a different equilibrium point. This is a common feature of many systems.\n4. **If there are interactions that remove energy from the system, the system will eventually come to rest at the equilibrium point.** This is a common feature of many systems.\n\n\n## Where are we going?\n\nThis work we are doing to understand equations of motion, stability, and equilibrium points is foundational. Some of the most exciting physics we see today is rooted in understanding how systems move away from equilibrium, and how they respond to external driving. [Chaos theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory) is a field that has grown out of understanding how systems can be very sensitive to initial conditions, and how they can exhibit complex behavior. \n\nWe will start to use these ideas from this week into next week as we build a set of additional tools like [phase space diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_space) and using asymptotic behavior to investigate and explain the behavior of physical systems. \n\nTo introduce some of those initial ideas here are two videos from different physics perspectives on the topic of chaos.\n\n\n### Veritasium - THe Butterfly Effect and Chaotic Systems (13 minute video)\n\nIn this video, Derek Muller uses the typical example of the Butterfly Effect to introduce the idea of chaos theory. The philosophical aspects of the butterfly effect are interesting, but not real in any physical sense. Instead, it's a metaphor for the idea that small changes in initial conditions can lead to large changes in the system. Muller contrasts our understanding of determinism with uncertainty; he introduces the concepts of sensitivity to initial conditions and discusses the idea of an attractor. \n\n[![Chaos Theory](../images/notes/week6/fDek6cYijxI.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDek6cYijxI)\n\n### University of Bristol - Chaos Theory and Randomness (8 minute video)\n\nIn this video, two researchers from the University of Bristol ([Jens Marklof](https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~majm/) and [Henna Koivusalo](https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~te20281/)) discuss the idea of chaos theory from a more mathematical perspective - remdining us of the differences between randomness and chaos. The overlap between physicists and mathematicians in the study of chaos is significant. One important contribution is [Dynamical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system), which is a mathematical framework that is used to study these behaviors. The researchers who do this work are mathematicians, physicists, engineers, and computer scientists. They do experiments, but they also do a lot of mathematical modeling.\n\n[![Chaos Theory](../images/notes/week6/5fRhasVmcUE.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fRhasVmcUE)\n\n\n"

        "# Week 6 - Notes: Stability and Energy\n\n\nYou have likely already heard of the concept of stability in other classes or contexts. The idea that something is \"stable\" is a well understood concept in everyday language, but here we mean to put some precision on the statement. \n\n* What do we mean by stable?\n* And what forms of stability are there? \n* What are the implications of stability for the behavior of a system?\n\nWe will start this from the perspective of force and then relate it to the potential energy. Ultimately, we will develop a toolkit for understanding the stability of a system and how to analyze it.\n\nFurther, we will introduce the idea of [fixed points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_point_(mathematics)) and how they relate to stability. These fixed points, or equilibrium points, are the points where the system is at rest, or it would be if it were not disturbed. They are important to identify because they are the first concept in the larger narrative of stability. Later, we will see how systems can produce other structures like [limit cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_cycle) and [chaotic attractors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor). Indeed, in some cases, we can parameterize the system, by choosing a tuneable variable, to produce any of these structures.\n\n## What is an equilibrium point?\n\nThis might have an obvious answer to you if you think about a vertical pendulum. Obviously, the bottom of the swing has some special meaning, and it is the point that the pendulum will return to if it is not disturbed. As, surely, you can surmise, this is an equilibrium point for this system.\n\nBut what about the location at the top of the swing? The location directly opposite the bottom of the swing? It turns out that is also an equilibrium point. But there is something very different about these two points. \n\nThe bottom of the swing is a stable equilibrium point, while the top of the swing is an unstable equilibrium point. This basic idea that we can identify points in the system where the system is at rest is a powerful concept. Moreover, we already have some intuition about the stability of these points; for example, the bottom of the swing is a lower potential energy state, while the top of the swing is a higher potential energy state.\n\n## How can we identify equilibrium points?\n\nStarting from Newton's second law, we can write the equation of motion for a system. This equation will be a differential equation that describes how the system evolves in time. For the pendulum without a small angle approximation, we have the following equation of motion:\n\n$$m L \\ddot{\\theta} = -m g \\sin(\\theta)$$\n\nWhere $m$ is the mass of the pendulum, $L$ is the length of the pendulum, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $\\theta$ is the angle of the pendulum from the vertical; measured from the bottom of the swing.\n\nTo find the equilibrium points we search for the points where $\\ddot{\\theta} = 0$. This is the point where the system is at rest, or instantaneously at rest. In this case, we have:\n\n$$0 = -g \\sin(\\theta),$$\n\n$$\\sin(\\theta) = 0.$$\n\nNow, we know that the angle theta here is measurable around the entire circles as we did not make the small angle approximation. Thus, we find that the equilibrium points are at:\n\n$$\\theta = 0\\;\\mathrm{and}\\;\\theta = \\pi,$$\n\ncorresponding to the bottom and top of the swing, respectively. There are in fact an infinite number of equilibrium points for this system, but these are the only unique points. The others would correspond to multiple rotations around the circle.\n\n### What is happening here? Where does energy come into play?\n\nWhat we've done is use the equation of motion to find the points where the system is at rest. But we can also think of this in terms of the potential energy of the system. The strength of the potential energy view is that there's another representation of the system that can be used to understand the stability of the equilibrium points, namely the graph of the potential energy. We can use this energy landscape to help us see the stability of the equilibrium points.\n\nThe potential energy of the pendulum that we have been discussing is given by:\n\n$$U(\\theta) = -m g L \\cos(\\theta).$$\n\nLet's graph this potential energy and see what it looks like.\n\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n\nplt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8-colorblind')\n\ntheta = np.linspace(-np.pi, np.pi, 1000)\nU = -9.8 * np.cos(theta)\n\n\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))\n\nplt.plot(theta, U)\n\nplt.xlabel(r'$\\theta$')\nplt.ylabel(r'$U(\\theta)$')\n\nplt.xticks([-np.pi, -np.pi/2, 0, np.pi/2, np.pi],\n           [r'$-\\pi$', r'$-\\pi/2$', r'$0$', r'$\\pi/2$', r'$\\pi$'])\nplt.yticks([-10, -5, 0, 5, 10], ['-10', '-5',  '0', '5', '10'])\n\nplt.title('Potential Energy of a Pendulum')\n\nplt.grid()\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n```\n\n\n    \n![png](06_notes_files/06_notes_4_0.png)\n    \n\n\nWe can see where the equilibrium points are by noticing they are the minima and maxima of the potential energy. In fact, these fixed points are the extrema of the potential energy. The bottom of the swing is a minimum, while the top of the swing is a maximum. This is a general property of fixed/equilibrium points that are derived from a potential energy function.\n\nWe also can see then how we might find these points by looking at the potential energy. Given a potential energy function, we can find the equilibrium points by finding the extrema of the potential energy. \n\nLet's return to the pendulum example. \n\n$$U(\\theta) = -m g L \\cos(\\theta).$$\n\nThe first derivative of the potential energy is:\n\n$$\\frac{dU}{d\\theta} = m g L \\sin(\\theta).$$\n\nSetting this equal to zero, we find the equilibrium points:\n\n$$\\sin(\\theta) = 0,$$\n\n$$\\theta = 0\\;\\mathrm{and}\\;\\theta = \\pi.$$\n\nThis is the same result we found from the equation of motion. This approach is generally applicable to potential energy functions because the equation of motion is derived from the potential energy through it's gradient. In 1D,\n\n$$m a = F = -\\frac{dU}{dx}.$$\n\nOr in 3D,\n\n$$m \\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{F} = -\\nabla U.$$\n\nIn the case of the pendulum, we have:\n\n$$m L \\ddot{\\theta} = -\\frac{dU}{d\\theta},$$\n\n$$m L \\ddot{\\theta} = -m g L \\sin(\\theta).$$\n\n## How can we determine the stability of an equilibrium point?\n\nClearly from our intuition, the bottom of the swing is a stable equilibrium point, while the top of the swing is an unstable equilibrium point. But how can we determine this mathematically? We have found that the equilibrium points are at $\\theta = 0$ and $\\theta = \\pi$. \n\nLet's plot the potential energy again and include the equilibrium points. We know which are stable and which are unstable, but let's see if we can determine this from the potential energy.\n\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n\nplt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8-colorblind')\n\ntheta = np.linspace(-np.pi, np.pi, 1000)\nU = -9.8 * np.cos(theta)\n\n\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))\n\nplt.plot(theta, U)\nplt.plot(0, -9.8, 'C2*', label='stable', markersize=20)\nplt.plot(-np.pi, 9.8, 'C3*', label='unstable', markersize=20)\nplt.plot(+np.pi, 9.8, 'C3*', markersize=20)\n\n\nplt.xlabel(r'$\\theta$')\nplt.ylabel(r'$U(\\theta)$')\n\nplt.xticks([-np.pi, -np.pi/2, 0, np.pi/2, np.pi],\n           [r'$-\\pi$', r'$-\\pi/2$', r'$0$', r'$\\pi/2$', r'$\\pi$'])\nplt.yticks([-10, -5, 0, 5, 10], ['-10', '-5',  '0', '5', '10'])\n\nplt.title('Potential Energy of a Pendulum')\nplt.legend()\n\nplt.grid()\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n```\n\n\n    \n![png](06_notes_files/06_notes_7_0.png)\n    \n\n\nSo it's clear that the equilibrium points are the extrema of the potential energy. We can determine their stability in the same way we identified them. We look at the local curvature of the potential energy at the equilibrium points. If we find that the second derivative of the potential energy is positive, then the equilibrium point is stable. If the second derivative is negative, then the equilibrium point is unstable.\n\nLet's calculate the second derivative of the potential energy for the pendulum:\n\n$$U(\\theta) = -m g L \\cos(\\theta),$$\n\n$$\\frac{dU(\\theta)}{d\\theta} = m g L \\sin(\\theta),$$\n\n$$\\frac{d^2U(\\theta)}{d\\theta^2} = m g L \\cos(\\theta).$$\n\nAt the bottom of the swing, $\\theta = 0$, we have:\n\n$$\\frac{d^2U(\\theta = 0)}{d\\theta^2} = m g L > 0.$$\n\nAt the top of the swing, $\\theta = \\pm\\pi$, we have:\n\n$$\\frac{d^2U(\\theta = \\pm\\pi)}{d\\theta^2} = -m g L < 0.$$\n\nThus, we have confirmed that the bottom of the swing is a stable equilibrium point, while the top of the swing is an unstable equilibrium point.\n\n## Our new toolkit\n\nWe now have a set of tools to help us understand the stability of a system. We can find the equilibrium points by setting the acceleration to zero, or by setting the first derivative of the potential energy to zero. We can determine the stability of these points by looking at the curvature of the potential energy at these points. \n\nIf we have a system that can be described fully by a potential energy function, we can use this toolkit to understand the stability of the system. We will develop a broader class of tools for when the system is not fully described by a potential energy function, or for multi-dimensional systems. But this is a good start.\n\n1. Write out the potential energy function for the system, $U(x)$.\n2. Find all the extrema, $x^*$, of the potential energy by setting the first derivative to zero, $\\frac{dU}{dx} = 0$. These are the equilibrium points.\n3. Evaluate the second derivative of the potential energy at each of these points, $\\frac{d^2U(x=x^*)}{dx^2}$. If this is positive, the equilibrium point is stable. If it is negative, the equilibrium point is unstable. If it's zero, it might be [metastable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastability).\n\n\n"

        "# Week 6 - Notes: Linear and Angular Momentum\n\n\n\nWe've talked about the central conservation laws of classical mechanics: \n\n* Conservation of energy - in a process, if energy is conserved, the total energy of the system is the same before and after the process. More strongly, in a closed system, the total energy is constant for any process ($dE_{sys}/dt=0$).\n* Conservation of linear momentum - in a process, if momentum is conserved, the total momentum of the system is the same before and after the process. More strongly, in a closed system, the total *vector* momentum is constant for any process ($d\\vec{p}_{sys}/dt=0$).\n* Conservation of angular momentum - in a process, if angular momentum is conserved, the total angular momentum of the system is the same before and after the process. More strongly, in a closed system, the total *vector* angular momentum is constant for any process ($d\\vec{L}_{sys}/dt=0$).\n\nWe've worked with the conservation of energy a lot because it's a fundamental concept in physics and it lends itself to a scalar equation analysis. This can be quite a bit simpler in many cases, but an energy only view of the world can be limiting.\n\n## Linear Momentum\n\nAs we move into the formal study of linear momentum, we will start with a reminder of the definition of momentum, and the mathematical form of the conservation of momentum.\n\nLinear momentum is a vector quantity defined as the product of an object's mass and its velocity. It is denoted by the symbol $\\vec{p}$ and is defined as:\n\n$$\\vec{p} = m\\vec{v}$$\n\nwhere $m$ is the mass of the object and $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the object. The SI unit of momentum is kg m/s. As we later came to understand with [Einstein's special theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity), this definition of momentum is the classical limit of the relativistic momentum:\n\n$$\\vec{p} = \\gamma m\\vec{v}$$\n\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor,\n\n$$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}.$$\n\nAs you can calculate, the relativistic momentum reduces to the classical momentum when the velocity is much less than the speed of light. As $v/c \\rightarrow 0$, $\\gamma \\rightarrow 1$, and the relativistic momentum reduces to the classical momentum.\n\n\n### Linear Momentum and Newton's Second Law\n\nYou have seen in our discussion of Newton's Second Law that the net force on a system is equal to the mass of the system times the acceleration of the system. This can be written as:\n\n$$\\vec{F}_{net}=m\\vec{a}.$$\n\nHowever, this definition and our thinking here with it is a bit limited. What about systems of objects that are interacting with each other? What about deformable systems? What happens if something is shedding mass, like a rocket or jet? \n\nNewton's definition from [the Principia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophi%C3%A6_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica) is a bit more general. He defines the force in terms of the rate of change of the body's momentum:\n\n$$\\vec{F}_{net}=\\frac{d\\vec{p}}{dt}.$$\n\nWe can extend that definition to a system of objects, where the net force on the system is equal to the rate of change of the total momentum of the system:\n\n$$\\vec{F}_{net}=\\frac{d\\vec{p}_{sys}}{dt}.$$\n\nThe second step might not be obvious, but by working through a few examples we can see how this is a more useful and general definition of force.\n\n### Forces internal to a system zero out\n\nConsider an abstract system of $N$ particles. You might think of them as point particles but they could be extended objects. They experience outside forces and internal forces; i.e., we go a tag all the particles in our system and we can tell which ones are interacting with each other. We can also tell which ones are interacting with the outside world. This is a bit silly, but it can help us visualize what we are arguing below.\n\nThe total force on the system is given by the sum of all the masses times the acceleration of each particle:\n\n$$\\vec{F}_{total} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i\\vec{a}_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\vec{F}_i$$\n\nwhere the last term is the net force on the $ith$ particle. For a given object, $i$, the net force is the sum of all the forces acting on it, both internal and external,\n\n$$\\vec{F}_{i} = \\vec{F}_{i}^{int} + \\vec{F}_{i}^{ext}.$$\n\nHere these internal forces are pairwise interactions between the particle $i$ and every other particle in the system, \n\n$$\\vec{F}_{i}^{int} = \\sum_{j\\neq i}^{N} \\vec{F}_{ij},$$\n\nwhere the sum is over all particles that are not $i$ because there's no force between a particle and itself. \n\nCool, what happens to the internal force equation when we sum over all particles in the system?\n\n#### Concrete Examples\n\nWe have a generic setup, let's see what happens when we apply this to a few examples: 2 particles, 3 particles, and then N particles.\n\n##### Two Particles\n\nWith two particles the sum is easy to write out fully.\n\n$$\\vec{F}_{int} = \\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\vec{F}_{i}^{int}$$\n\n$$\\vec{F}_{int} = \\sum_{i=1}^2 \\sum_{j\\neq i}^{2} \\vec{F}_{ij}$$\n\n$$\\vec{F}_{int} = \\vec{F}_{12} + \\vec{F}_{21} = 0$$\n\nBy Newton's Third Law, the force of particle 1 on particle 2 is equal and opposite to the force of particle 2 on particle 1. The internal forces cancel out and the net force on the system is the sum of the external forces.\n\n$$\\vec{F}_{12} = -\\vec{F}_{21}$$\n\nSo here the internal forces sum to zero.\n\n$$\\vec{F}_{int} = 0$$\n\n\n##### Three Particles\n\nWe can write this out in a similar way.\n\n$$\\vec{F}_{int} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\vec{F}_{i}^{int}$$\n\n$$\\vec{F}_{int} = \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\sum_{j\\neq i}^{3} \\vec{F}_{ij}$$\n\n$$\\vec{F}_{int} = \\vec{F}_{12} + \\vec{F}_{13} + \\vec{F}_{23} + \\vec{F}_{21} + \\vec{F}_{31} + \\vec{F}_{32}$$\n\nWe can group these terms by Newton's Third Law pairs.\n\n$$\\vec{F}_{int} = (\\vec{F}_{12} + \\vec{F}_{21}) + (\\vec{F}_{13} + \\vec{F}_{31}) + (\\vec{F}_{23} + \\vec{F}_{32}) = 0$$\n\nEvery interaction on body $i$ has a corresponding equal and opposite interaction on body $j$, and the internal forces are again zero.\n\n$$\\vec{F}_{int} = 0$$\n\n\n##### N Particles\n\nClearly, there seems to be a pattern here. Namely that the internal forces are always zero. We can write out the sum for $N$ particles in a way that suggests this is always true.\n\n$$\\vec{F}_{int} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\vec{F}_{i}^{int}$$\n\n$$\\vec{F}_{int} = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\sum_{j\\neq i}^{N} \\vec{F}_{ij}$$\n\nAnd where we make a switch  in the sum terms, so we can counting the force from each interaction in each term in the sum to make it clear why the internal forces sum to zero.\n\n$$\\vec{F}_{int} = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\sum_{j>i}^{N} \\left(\\underbrace{\\vec{F}_{ij} + \\vec{F}_{ji}}_{\\mathrm{always}\\,0}\\right) = 0$$\n\nInternal forces will always appear as third law pairs, so the internal interactions will always sum to zero. This is a very powerful result. \n\n$$\\vec{F}_{int} = 0\\,\\mathrm{,\\,always}$$\n\n**For a given system, only external forces can change the momentum.**\n\n### Mathematical Form of Conservation of Linear Momentum\n\nLet's look back at the system momentum,\n\n$$\\vec{p}_{sys} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i\\vec{v}_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\vec{p}_i.$$\n\nIf we take the time derivative of the system momentum, and assume we have point particles, so the masses are not changing,\n\n$$\\dfrac{d\\vec{p}_{sys}}{dt} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i\\dfrac{d\\vec{v}_i}{dt} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i\\vec{a}_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\vec{F}_i$$\n\nThe net force on the system is given by,\n\n$$\\vec{F}_{net} = \\vec{F}_{int} + \\vec{F}_{ext}.$$\n\nShould there be no external forces, then,\n\n$$\\vec{F}_{net} = \\vec{F}_{int} = 0.$$\n\nAnd thus there is no change momentum of the system,\n\n$$\\dfrac{d\\vec{p}_{sys}}{dt} = 0.$$\n\nSo if the system has no external forces, the total momentum of the system is conserved. We can propose a discrete extension to this form above where \n\n$$\\dfrac{d\\vec{p}_{sys}}{dt} \\approx \\dfrac{\\Delta\\vec{p}_{sys}}{\\Delta t} = 0.$$\n\nAnd thus, it's easy to see:\n\n$$\\Delta \\vec{p}_{sys} = \\vec{p}_{sys,f} - \\vec{p}_{sys,i} = 0.$$\n\nIf there are external forces, then we also have a prediction equation for how the energy will change in a small time step $\\Delta t$:\n\n$$\\Delta \\vec{p}_{sys} = \\vec{p}_{sys,f} - \\vec{p}_{sys,i} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\vec{F}_{ext,i}\\Delta t,$$\n\nso that,\n\n$$\\vec{p}_{sys,f} = \\vec{p}_{sys,i} + \\vec{F}_{ext}\\Delta t.$$\n\n## Angular Momentum\n\n[Angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum) is a complex and rich quantity that has deep connections to the shape and structure of a system. The \"configuration\" or how it is distributed in space can have a big impact on the dynamics of a system. Our study of classical angular momentum will be a stepping stone to our study of [quantum angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum_operator) and the [spin]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics)]) of particles. \n\n:::{admonition} Quantum Mechanical Spin\n:class: information\n[Spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics)) is a quantum mechanical property that is not related to the rotation of a particle, but it is a form of angular momentum, and it's essential to the structure of the universe - it tells us if we have [fermionic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermion) or [bosonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boson) particles, it is what gives us the [Pauli Exclusion Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_exclusion_principle), and it is what gives us the [Zeeman Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeeman_effect) and the [Stark Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stark_effect).\n:::\n\nFor the moment, we will limit ourselves to classical angular momentum and we will focus on the abstract case of a single particle. As we work through the semester, we will revisit angular momentum and introduce how to work with distributions of mass and extended objects.\n\n### Definition of Angular Momentum\n\nFor a particle with a momentum $\\vec{p}$, the angular momentum is defined as the cross product of the position vector $\\vec{r}$ and the momentum vector $\\vec{p}$,\n\n$$\\vec{L} = \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{p} = m \\left(\\vec{r} \\times \\vec{v}\\right).$$\n\nThis is a quantity that depends on the location of the particle relative origin of coordinates. This means you have some latitude in choosing the origin of coordinates, and you can choose the origin to simplify the problem.\n\nThis also means the angular momentum is a vector quantity, and it points in the direction perpendicular to the plane defined by the position and momentum vectors. \n\n### When is Angular Momentum Conserved?\n\nWe can ask this by computing the time derivative of the angular momentum,\n\n$$\\dfrac{d\\vec{L}}{dt} = \\dfrac{d}{dt}\\left(\\vec{r} \\times \\vec{p}\\right) = 0?$$\n\nWe did a calculation like this on a homework where we computed\n\n$$\\dfrac{d}{dt}\\left(\\vec{a}\\times\\vec{b}\\right) = \\vec{a}\\times\\dfrac{d\\vec{b}}{dt} + \\dfrac{d\\vec{a}}{dt}\\times\\vec{b}.$$\n\nLet's apply it here:\n\n$$\\dfrac{d\\vec{L}}{dt} = \\dfrac{d}{dt}\\left(\\vec{r} \\times \\vec{p}\\right) = \\dfrac{d\\vec{r}}{dt} \\times \\vec{p} + \\vec{r} \\times \\dfrac{d\\vec{p}}{dt}.$$\n\nIf we assume that $\\dot{m}=0$, then we can write the time derivative of the momentum as,\n\n$$\\dfrac{d\\vec{p}}{dt} = \\dfrac{d}{dt}\\left(m\\vec{v}\\right) = m\\dfrac{d\\vec{v}}{dt}$$\n\nWe group the terms in the time derivative of the angular momentum,\n\n$$\\dfrac{d\\vec{L}}{dt} = m \\underbrace{\\dfrac{d\\vec{r}}{dt} \\times \\vec{v}}_{=0} + m\\vec{r} \\times \\dfrac{d\\vec{v}}{dt}.$$\n\nThe first term the cross product of the velocity with itself $\\vec{v}\\times\\vec{v}$, and is zero, and the second term is the cross product of the position vector with the acceleration,\n\n$$\\dfrac{d\\vec{L}}{dt} = m\\vec{r} \\times \\dfrac{d\\vec{v}}{dt} = \\vec{r}\\times m\\vec{a}.$$\n\nSo the time derivative of the angular momentum is the net torque on the system!\n\n$$\\vec{\\tau}_{net} = \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{F}_{net}.$$\n\n$$\\dfrac{d\\vec{L}}{dt} = \\vec{r}\\times m\\vec{a} = \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{F}_{net}$$\n\n$$\\dfrac{d\\vec{L}}{dt} = \\vec{\\tau}_{net}.$$\n\nIf the net torque on the system is zero, then the angular momentum is conserved, and it is a constant of the motion.\n\n$$\\dfrac{d\\vec{L}_{sys}}{dt} = 0.$$\n\n$$\\Delta \\vec{L}_{sys} = \\vec{L}_{sys,f} - \\vec{L}_{sys,i} = 0.$$\n\nIf there's a net torque, we have a discrete update equation for the angular momentum,\n\n$$\\vec{L}_{sys,f} = \\vec{L}_{sys,i} + \\vec{\\tau}_{net}\\Delta t.$$\n\n### Are we sure there are no internal torques that matter?\n\nWe can ask the same question we asked about internal forces. Are there internal torques that matter?  As before, let us define the total force on particle $i$ as the sum of internal and external forces,\n\n$$\\vec{F}_{i} = \\vec{F}_{i}^{int} + \\vec{F}_{i}^{ext}.$$\n\nWe assume there are no external forces, and so the net force on the system is the sum of the internal forces,\n\n$$\\vec{F}_{net} = \\vec{F}_{int}.$$\n\nFor given object, we observe an angular momentum $\\vec{l}_i$ that is the cross product of the position vector and the momentum vector. So the time derivative of the $i$th particle's angular momentum is,\n\n$$\\dfrac{d\\vec{l}_i}{dt} = \\vec{r}_i \\times \\vec{F}_i.$$\n\nIf the total angular momentum of the system is the sum of the angular momenta of the particles,\n\n$$\\vec{L} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\vec{l}_i,$$\n\nthen the time derivative of the total angular momentum is,\n\n$$\\dfrac{d\\vec{L}}{dt} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\dfrac{d\\vec{l}_i}{dt} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\vec{r}_i \\times \\vec{F}_i.$$\n\nRecall that $\\vec{F}_i = \\sum_{j\\neq i}^{N} \\vec{F}_{ij}$. So we can rewrite the time derivative of the total angular momentum as,\n\n$$\\dfrac{d\\vec{L}}{dt} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sum_{j\\neq i}^{N} \\vec{r}_i  \\times \\vec{F}_{ij} = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\sum_{j >i}^{N} \\left(\\vec{r}_i \\times \\vec{F}_{ij} + \\vec{r}_j \\times \\vec{F}_{ji}\\right)$$\n\nBut note that $\\vec{r}_i \\times \\vec{F}_{ij} = -\\vec{r}_j \\times \\vec{F}_{ji}$, so the resulting expression gives us,\n\n$$\\dfrac{d\\vec{L}}{dt} =\\sum_{i=1}^N \\sum_{j>i}^{N} \\left(\\vec{r}_i - \\vec{r}_j\\right)\\times \\vec{F}_{ij}.$$\n\nSo if the internal forces are parallel to the separation between the particles, then the internal torques sum to zero, and the total angular momentum of the system is conserved. So things like the gravitational force, the electric force, and spring forces are all internal forces that do not contribute to the net torque on the system.\n\nAnd thus,\n\n$$\\dfrac{d\\vec{L}_{sys}}{dt} = 0.$$\n\n\n```python\n\n```\n\n\n```python\n\n```\n\n\n"

        "# Week 7 - Nonlinear Dynamics\n\nWe have now built enough tools to tackle some challenging physical systems that have nonlinear equations of motion. The broader field of study that deals with these systems is called [Nonlinear Dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_system). Nonlinear dynamics or nonlinear science is the study of systems that are described by nonlinear equations. These systems are often chaotic, meaning they are highly sensitive to initial conditions. In many cases, these systems are treated using [dynamical systems theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system).\n\nNonlinear dynamics is the science that has helped us understand the dynamics of [fluids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations), [water waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kadomtsev%E2%80%93Petviashvili_equation), [crystals and other optical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_optics), [radio waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li%C3%A9nard_equation), [the weather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_weather_prediction), and countless other systems. It has been used in [fluid dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbulence), [plasma physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_modeling), [mechanical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_pendulum), and many other fields. [Chaos theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory) is associated with nonlinear dynamics and is a subset of the field. Recently, this work has extended to quantum systems, where the Hamiltonian is nonlinear. [Quantum chaos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chaos) is a field that studies the quantum analog of classical chaotic systems.\n\n## Nonlinear Differential Equations \n\nDifferential equations are the language of classical mechanics. They describe how the systems we investigate evolve over time. They track the [state variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_variable) of the system, which are what define the system. For us, this is often the position components and the velocity components of the system. The video below gives a good overview of what differential equations are and why they are important for our study. It also provides an introduction to the concept of a [phase space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_space), which is the space defined by all the state variables of the system.\n\n### Differential equations, a tourist's guide (27 min)\n\n[![Differential Equations](../images/notes/week7/p_di4Zn4wz4.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_di4Zn4wz4)\n\nSource: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_di4Zn4wz4>\n\n## Phase Portraits\n\nSolving non-linear equations can be quite difficult, and in most cases, we can't find an analytical solution. We can numerically integrate the equations to find specific trajectories. But this is a fairly inefficient approach, especially when nonlinear systems exhibit such complex behavior and are so sensitive to initial conditions. \n\nWe can also use a technique called [phase portraits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_portrait) to understand the behavior of these systems. A phase portrait is a graphical representation of the trajectories of a dynamical system in the phase space. That space is defined by the combination of all the state variables of the system. For example, a simple pendulum has two state variables: the angle and the angular velocity. The phase portrait of the pendulum is a plot of the angular velocity against the angle. Or for the harmonic oscillator, the phase portrait is a plot of the velocity against the position.\n\n*Phase portraits are quite useful for second order differential equations (or any two-dimensional system) because we frequently use and interpret 2D graphs.* Notice that we focused on \"2nd order differential equations\" not \"linear 2nd order.\" That is because, as we will see, **phase portraits are particularly useful for nonlinear 2nd order differential equations.**\n\nWe will go into the details of how to construct and develop phase portraits in class. This video from [Steve Brunton](https://www.me.washington.edu/facultyfinder/steve-brunton) is a good overview of the process. It's quite detailed and takes a mathematical perspective, so don't worry if you don't understand everything in the video. We have plenty of time to investigate how this works in practice.\n\n### Drawing Phase Portraits for Nonlinear Systems (26 min)\n\n[![Drawing Phase Portraits for Nonlinear Systems](../images/notes/week7/vBwyD4JJlSs.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBwyD4JJlSs)\n\nSource: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBwyD4JJlSs>\n\n\n"

        "# Week 7 - Notes: Critical Points; Phase Space; Trajectories\n\nThus far, we have developed an approach to solving differential equations for particular trajectories of the different classical systems that we have studied. Typically, we work to develop the equations of motion for a system using Newton's Second Law. Those equations typically have the form\n\n$$\\ddot{\\vec{x}} = f(\\vec{x}, \\dot{\\vec{x}}, t),$$\n\nwhere $\\vec{x}$ is the position vector of the system, $\\dot{\\vec{x}}$ is the velocity vector of the system, and $f$ is some function that depends on the position, velocity, and time. In 1D, we have studied a number of systems where the equations of motion takes the form:\n\n$$\\ddot{x} = f(x, \\dot{x}, t).$$\n\nOur approach has been to find ways of solving these equations for a given set of initial conditions ($x_0$, $v_0$, at $t=t_0$) to get individual trajectories of the system.\n\n$$x(t)\\; \\text{and}\\; v(t)\\; \\text{for}\\; t \\geq t_0.$$\n\n## Developing a General Understanding of Motion\n\nHowever, some of the equations of motion we have developed (in fact, most) cannot be solved in a \"closed form\", which is what gives rise to analytical trajectories. In these cases, we have used numerical methods to solve the equations of motion.\n\nIt also seems pretty inefficient to have to solve the equations of motion for every possible set of initial conditions. It would be nice if we could develop a general understanding of the behavior of the system without having to solve the equations of motion for every possible set of initial conditions.\n\nFinally, we often care less about particular trajectories and more about the general behavior of the system. For example, we might want to know if the system is stable, or if it will oscillate, or if it will spiral in or out. We seek to understand qualitatively different solutions to the equations of motion.\n\nIn this week, we will take a step back and consider the general structure of the solutions to these equations. We will introduce the concept of a critical point, and we will discuss how the phase space of a system can be used to understand the behavior of the system.  This approach will help us broaden our understanding of the solutions to differential equations and the behavior of classical systems. It also gives us a new set of tools and ways of thinking about the systems that we have been studying.\n\n## Example: A Nonlinear 1st Order ODE\n\nConsider the following first-order ordinary differential equation:\n\n$$\\dot{x} = \\sin x.$$\n\nLet's assume we want to find $x(t)$ for a given set of initial conditions $x_0$ at $t=t_0$. This equation is nonlinear, but we can make some progress by separating variables:\n\n$$\\frac{dx}{\\sin x} = dt.$$\n\nWe can integrate both sides to get:\n\n$$\\int \\frac{dx}{\\sin x} = \\int dt.$$\n\nThe integral on the left-hand side is one that we can look up:\n\n$$\\int \\frac{dx}{\\sin x} = \\ln\\left|\\csc\\left(x\\right) + \\cot\\left(x\\right)\\right| + C.$$\n\nCool. So we have:\n\n$$t-t_0 = \\ln\\left|\\csc\\left(x\\right) + \\cot\\left(x\\right)\\right| - \\ln\\left|\\csc\\left(x_0\\right) + \\cot\\left(x_0\\right)\\right|,$$\n\n$$t-t_0 = \\ln\\left|\\frac{\\csc\\left(x\\right) + \\cot\\left(x\\right)}{\\csc\\left(x_0\\right) + \\cot\\left(x_0\\right)}\\right|.$$\n\nWell how do solve for $x(t)$? That's not so easy. And a harder question is: what does the motion look like?\n\nWe need a new approach.\n\n### A Geometric Analysis\n\nLet us instead plot the equation $\\dot{x} = \\sin x$ in the [phase space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_space) of the system. Here, we are plotting the velocity of the system as a function of the position of the system. This is a common approach to understanding the behavior of a system.\n\nIn 1D, this plot is called a 'Flow on a Line'. That is because we can characterize the behavior of the system by the direction of the flow of the system in the phase space. In this case, the flow is given by the function $\\sin x$. A positive $\\sin x$ means that the system is moving to the right, and a negative $\\sin x$ means that the system is moving to the left. We plot it below with some additional information.\n\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8-colorblind')\n\nx = np.linspace(-7/2*np.pi, 7/2*np.pi, 1000)\nxdot = np.sin(x)\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 5))\n\nax.plot(x, xdot, 'k', label=r'$\\dot{x} = \\sin(x)$')\n\nax.axhline(0, color='black', linewidth=2)\nax.axvline(0, color='black', linewidth=2)\n\nplt.plot([-3*np.pi, -np.pi, np.pi, 3*np.pi], [0, 0, 0, 0], \n         'C1o', \n         markersize=12,\n         label='Stable fixed points')\n\nplt.plot([-2*np.pi, 0, 2*np.pi], [0, 0,  0], \n         'C2o', \n         markersize=12, \n         markerfacecolor='none',\n         markeredgewidth=2,\n         markeredgecolor='C2',\n         label='Unstable fixed points')\n\nplt.plot([-5/2*np.pi, -np.pi/2, 3*np.pi/2, 7/2*np.pi], [0, 0, 0, 0], \n         'k<', \n         markersize=12,\n         label='Flow to the left')\nplt.plot([-7/2*np.pi, -3/2*np.pi, np.pi/2, 5/2*np.pi], [0, 0, 0, 0], \n         'k>', \n         markersize=12,\n         label='Flow to the right')\n\nplt.legend(loc='upper right')\n\nax.set_xlabel(r'x')\nax.set_ylabel(r'$\\dot{x}$', rotation=0)\nax.grid()\nxticks = [-4*np.pi, -7*np.pi/2, -3*np.pi, -5*np.pi/2, -2*np.pi, -3*np.pi/2, -np.pi, -np.pi/2, 0, np.pi/2, np.pi, 3*np.pi/2, 2*np.pi, 5*np.pi/2, 3*np.pi, 7*np.pi/2, 4*np.pi]\nxticks_labels = [r'$-4\\pi$', r'$-\\frac{7\\pi}{2}$', r'$-3\\pi$', r'$-\\frac{5\\pi}{2}$', r'$-2\\pi$', r'$-\\frac{3\\pi}{2}$', r'$-\\pi$', r'$-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$', r'$0$', r'$\\frac{\\pi}{2}$', r'$\\pi$', r'$\\frac{3\\pi}{2}$', r'$2\\pi$', r'$\\frac{5\\pi}{2}$', r'$3\\pi$', r'$\\frac{7\\pi}{2}$', r'$4\\pi$']\nax.set_xticks(xticks)\nax.set_xticklabels(xticks_labels)\nplt.xlim(-7/2*np.pi, 7/2*np.pi)\nplt.ylim(-2.5, 2.5)\nplt.tight_layout()\n```\n\n\n    \n![png](07_notes_files/07_notes_2_0.png)\n    \n\n\nThe plot we have made is called a 'Phase Portrait'. It is a plot of the velocity of the system as a function of the position of the system. The arrows indicate the direction of the flow of the system. The critical points of the system are the points where the flow is zero. These are the points where the system is at rest (i.e., $\\dot{x} = 0$).\n\nIn this case, the critical points are at $x = n\\pi$, where $n$ is an integer. At these points, the system is at rest. The system will move to the right if $\\dot{x} > 0$ and to the left if $\\dot{x} < 0$. We have indicated that flow direction with arrows on the line.\n\nFrom those flow directions, we can also find the 'critical points' of the motion. These are the points where the flow changes direction, and they are found by setting $\\dot{x} = 0$. In this case, the critical points are at $x = n\\pi$, where $n$ is an integer. In some cases, that point is stable (green solid circle) and in other cases, it is unstable (red open circle). You can see why from the flow directions; for stable points, the flow on both sides of the critical point is towards the critical point, and for unstable points, the flow on both sides of the critical point is away from the critical point.\n\n### What does the motion look like?\n\nWe can see from the phase portrait, that motion that doesn't start on a critical point will eventually move towards the stable critical point. This is because the flow direction is always towards the stable critical point. We also can note that depending on the location of the particle to start, it will move to the left or right to reach the stable critical point. And we also notice that the motion is often accelerated up a to a maximum velocity and then decelerated down to zero velocity as it approaches the critical point -- this is the sinusoidal nature of the velocity function.\n\n## Another Example: A Polynomial 1st Order ODE\n\nConsider instead the following first-order ordinary differential equation:\n\n$$\\dot{x} = x^3 - x.$$\n\nWe can find the critical points of this system by setting $\\dot{x} = 0$:\n\n$$x^3 - x = 0,$$\n\n$$x(x^2 - 1) = 0,$$\n\n$$x(x-1)(x+1) = 0.$$\n\nSo that there are three critical points: $x = 0$, $x = 1$, and $x = -1$. We can plot the phase portrait of this system below along with a little more information.\n\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8-colorblind')\n\nx = np.linspace(-7/2*np.pi, 7/2*np.pi, 1000)\nxdot = x**3-x\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 5))\n\nax.plot(x, xdot, 'k', label=r'$\\dot{x} = x^3 - x$')\n\nax.axhline(0, color='black', linewidth=2)\nax.axvline(0, color='black', linewidth=2)\n\nplt.plot([0], [0], \n         'C1o', \n         markersize=12,\n         label='Stable fixed points')\n\nplt.plot([-1, 1], [0,  0], \n         'C2o', \n         markersize=12, \n         markerfacecolor='none',\n         markeredgewidth=2,\n         markeredgecolor='C2',\n         label='Unstable fixed points')\n\nplt.plot([-1.5, 0.5], [0, 0], \n         'k<', \n         markersize=12,\n         label='Flow to the left')\nplt.plot([-0.5, 1.5], [0, 0], \n         'k>', \n         markersize=12,\n         label='Flow to the right')\n\nplt.legend(loc='upper left')\nplt.xlim(-2, 2)\nplt.ylim(-3, 3)\nax.set_xlabel(r'x')\nax.set_ylabel(r'$\\dot{x}$', rotation=0)\nax.grid()\n\nplt.tight_layout()\n```\n\n\n    \n![png](07_notes_files/07_notes_5_0.png)\n    \n\n\n### What does the motion look like?\n\nFrom the phase potrait, we can see that for $|x_0| > 1$, the solutions run off to $|x| \\rightarrow |\\pm \\infty|$. Otherwise all solutions will approach the stable critical point at $x = 0$. \n\nNotice we did all this analysis without trying to solve the differential equation. We can understand the general behavior of the system by looking at the phase portrait. If we did try to solve it, we would find that the solutions are not easy to find in a closed form.\n\n$$\\dot{x} = x^3 - x,$$\n\n$$\\int \\frac{dx}{x^3 - x} = \\int dt,$$\n\n$$\\int_{x_0}^{x(f)} \\frac{dx}{x^3 - x} = t - 0.$$\n\n$$t = \\dfrac{1}{2}\\ln(1-x^2)|_{x_0}^{x(f)} -\\ln(x)|_{x_0}^{x(f)},$$\n\n$$t= \\dfrac{1}{2}\\ln\\left(\\dfrac{1-x(f)^2}{1-x_0^2}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\dfrac{x(f)}{x_0}\\right).$$\n\nAgain. OOF. That's a lot of work for a simple system.\n\n### Summary\n\nWe still need some tools to deal with finding trajectories for systems that are not easy to solve. But let's pause for a minute and appreciate what we have done. Without solving the differential equation, we have could characterize all possible solutions.\n\nNow, the next step is to do this with 2nd order differential equations. The analogy changes from a 'Flow on a line' to a 'Flow on a plane'. Let's introduce that with a simple example.\n\n\n## The Harmonic Oscillator Gets a Bad Rap\n\nWe've shown that the harmonic oscillator is a simple system to solve. But let's consider the following 2nd order differential equation where the force is not linear. This is the classical pendulum equation of motion where we have removed the small angle approximation and dispensed with the parameters that control the motion ($\\omega^2=1$).\n\n$$\\ddot{x} = -\\sin x.$$\n\nWe will model this system in phase space, but let us first take the linear approximation of the system. We can do this by expanding the $\\sin x$ term in a Taylor series:\n\n$$\\sin x \\approx x - \\dfrac{x^3}{3!} + \\dfrac{x^5}{5!} - \\dfrac{x^7}{7!} + \\ldots.$$\n\nIf we keep only the first term, we get the linear harmonic oscillator:\n\n$$\\ddot{x} = -x.$$\n\nNow, we transform the 2nd order differential equation into two 1st order differential equations:\n\n$$\\dot{x} = v,$$\n$$\\dot{v} = -x.$$\n\nThis gives us a description of the motion in phase space. We can plot the phase portrait of this system by considering that every point in phase space $\\langle x, v\\rangle$ has an arrow that is represented by the change that occurs at that location $\\langle \\dot{x}, \\dot{v} \\rangle = \\langle v, -x\\rangle$. This is a *strange* concept, but the logic is that how $x$ and $v$ change at a given point in phase space is given by the velocity vector at that point and it depends on the location that you are at in phase space. Let's plot this in parts below.\n\n### The $x=0$ line\n\nLet's first consider the vertical axis $x=0$. Note that we can directly compute this:\n\n$$\\langle \\dot{x}, \\dot{v} \\rangle = \\langle v,0 \\rangle.$$\n\nSo in the phase space, the arrows will be completely horizontal and will get larger as you move away from the origin.\n\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8-colorblind')\n\ndef returnPhase(x, xdot):\n    return (xdot, -x)\n\n# Points along the vertical axis\nv = np.linspace(-2, 2, 10)\nx = np.zeros_like(v)\n\n# Xompute the phase portrait\nxdot, ydot = returnPhase(x, v)\n\n# Plot the phase portrait as arrows\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 5))\nax.quiver(x, v, xdot, ydot)\nax.axhline(0, color='black', linewidth=2)\nax.axvline(0, color='black', linewidth=2)\nax.set_xlabel(r'$x$')\nax.set_ylabel(r'$\\dot{x}$', rotation=0)\nax.grid()\n\n```\n\n\n    \n![png](07_notes_files/07_notes_8_0.png)\n    \n\n\n### The $v=0$ line\n\nSimilarly, we can compute the arrows on the horizontal axis $v=0$:\n\n$$\\langle \\dot{x}, \\dot{v} \\rangle = \\langle 0,-x \\rangle.$$\n\nSo these will be completely vertical and will get larger as you move away from the origin. The negative sign indicates that the arrows will point up on the left side and down on the right side. Let's plot that.\n\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8-colorblind')\n\ndef returnPhase(x, xdot):\n    return (xdot, -x)\n\n# Points along the horizontal axis\nx = np.linspace(-2, 2, 10)\nv = np.zeros_like(x)\n\n# Xompute the phase portrait\nxdot, ydot = returnPhase(x, v)\n\n# Plot the phase portrait as arrows\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 5))\nax.quiver(x, v, xdot, ydot)\nax.axhline(0, color='black', linewidth=2)\nax.axvline(0, color='black', linewidth=2)\nax.set_xlabel(r'$x$')\nax.set_ylabel(r'$\\dot{x}$', rotation=0)\nax.grid()\n\n```\n\n\n    \n![png](07_notes_files/07_notes_10_0.png)\n    \n\n\n### Putting it all together\n\nWe could keep plotting like this and we will begin to connect the dots into a phase potrait. We have already built the code to do this in general above, but we need to make use of the 'meshgrid' function in numpy to make this work. [Meshgrid](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.meshgrid.html) is a function that generates a grid of points in 2D space. We can use it to take our 2 arrays for the space we are interested in and generate a grid of points that we can use to compute the arrows at each point. Let's plot the full phase portrait of the system below.\n\nWe also introduce the [streamplot](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.streamplot.html) function in matplotlib. This function connects the lines a little more smoothly and gives a better representation of the flow of the system.\n\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8-colorblind')\n\ndef returnPhase(x, xdot):\n    return (xdot, -x)\n\n# Points along the horizontal axis\nx = np.linspace(-2, 2, 10)\nv = x\n\n# Use meshgrid to create a grid\nX, V = np.meshgrid(x, v)\n\n# Compute the phase portrait\n# NOTE WE ARE NOW USING X, V\nxdot, ydot = returnPhase(X, V)\n\n# Plot the phase portrait as arrows and using a streamplot\n\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(10, 5))\n\nax1.streamplot(X, V, xdot, ydot, color='k')\nax1.title.set_text('SHO Streamplot')\nax1.axhline(0, color='black', linewidth=2)\nax1.axvline(0, color='black', linewidth=2)\nax1.set_xlabel(r'$x$')\nax1.set_ylabel(r'$\\dot{x}$', rotation=0)\nax1.grid()\n\nax2.quiver(X, V, xdot, ydot)\nax2.title.set_text('SHO Quiver')\nax2.axhline(0, color='black', linewidth=2)\nax2.axvline(0, color='black', linewidth=2)\nax2.set_xlabel(r'$x$')\nax2.set_ylabel(r'$\\dot{x}$', rotation=0)\nax2.grid()\n\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n```\n\n\n    \n![png](07_notes_files/07_notes_12_0.png)\n    \n\n\n### What does the motion look like?\n\nWell, it's the simple harmonic oscillator. The motion is periodic and sinusoidal. It's bounded in ellipses of increasing energy as you go outwards. The critical points are at the origin, where the system is at rest, but no trajectory will ever reach the origin except for the one that starts there. The system will oscillate back and forth forever. Total energy for any trajectory is conserved (that's why the ellipses are concentric). Each loop characterizes a full period of the motion for a given set of initial conditions. All initial conditions will lead to periodic motion, and all can be characterized by the phase portrait.\n\n#### How do we know the phase trajectories are ellipses?\n\nThe energy of the system is given by:\n\n$$E = \\dfrac{1}{2}mv^2 + \\dfrac{1}{2}kx^2.$$\n\nFor any one trajectory, the energy is conserved. So we can write:\n\n$$E = \\dfrac{1}{2}mv^2 + \\dfrac{1}{2}kx^2 = \\text{constant}.$$\n\nThis is the equation of an ellipse. We can rewrite it as:\n\n$$1 = \\dfrac{v^2}{2E/m} + \\dfrac{x^2}{2E/k}.$$\n\nThis ellipse is centered at the origin and has a semi-major axis of $\\sqrt{2E/k}$ and a semi-minor axis of $\\sqrt{2E/m}$. The energy of the system determines the size of the ellipse. The larger the energy, the larger the ellipse.\n\n### Returning to the Pendulum\n\nIn the pendulum problem, we have a second order non linear differential equation, which we can write as two first order equations:\n\n$$\\dot{x} = v,$$\n$$\\dot{v} = -\\sin x.$$\n\nWe can now use the infrastructure we have built to plot the phase portrait of the pendulum. We will plot the phase portrait of the pendulum below.\n\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8-colorblind')\n\ndef returnPhase(x, xdot):\n    return (xdot, -np.sin(x))\n\n# Points along the horizontal axis\nx = np.linspace(-5, 5, 20)\nv = x\n\n# Use meshgrid to create a grid\nX, V = np.meshgrid(x, v)\n\n# Compute the phase portrait\n# NOTE WE ARE NOW USING X, V\nxdot, ydot = returnPhase(X, V)\n\n# Plot the phase portrait as arrows and using a streamplot\n\nfig, ax1 = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(8, 6))\n\nax1.streamplot(X, V, xdot, ydot, color='k')\nax1.plot([0], [0], 'C1o', \n         markersize=12, \n         label='Stable fixed point')\n\nax1.plot([-np.pi, np.pi], [0, 0], 'C2o', \n         markersize=12, \n         markerfacecolor='none',\n         markeredgewidth=4,\n         label='Unstable fixed points')\n\nax1.title.set_text('Physical Pendulum Streamplot')\nax1.axhline(0, color='black', linewidth=2)\nax1.axvline(0, color='black', linewidth=2)\nax1.set_xlabel(r'$x$')\nax1.set_ylabel(r'$\\dot{x}$', rotation=0)\nax1.grid()\nax1.legend()\n\nplt.tight_layout()\n```\n\n\n    \n![png](07_notes_files/07_notes_15_0.png)\n    \n\n\n### What does the motion look like?\n\nNow, we see a more complex picture of the pendulum. The motion is still oscillatory and periodic, but it is definitely not sinusoidal. For very small choices of initial conditions, the motion is sinusoidal; we can zoom in an see we get near ellipses.\n\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8-colorblind')\n\ndef returnPhase(x, xdot):\n    return (xdot, -np.sin(x))\n\n# Points along the horizontal axis\nx = np.linspace(-0.5, 0.5, 20)\nv = x\n\n# Use meshgrid to create a grid\nX, V = np.meshgrid(x, v)\n\n# Compute the phase portrait\n# NOTE WE ARE NOW USING X, V\nxdot, ydot = returnPhase(X, V)\n\n# Plot the phase portrait as arrows and using a streamplot\n\nfig, ax1 = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(8, 6))\n\nax1.streamplot(X, V, xdot, ydot, color='k')\nax1.plot([0], [0], 'C1o', \n         markersize=12, \n         label='Stable fixed point')\n\n# ax1.plot([-np.pi, np.pi], [0, 0], 'C2o', \n#          markersize=12, \n#          markerfacecolor='none',\n#          markeredgewidth=4,\n#          label='Unstable fixed points')\n\nax1.title.set_text('Physical Pendulum Streamplot with zoom')\nax1.axhline(0, color='black', linewidth=2)\nax1.axvline(0, color='black', linewidth=2)\nax1.set_xlabel(r'$x$')\nax1.set_ylabel(r'$\\dot{x}$', rotation=0)\nax1.grid()\nax1.legend()\n\nplt.tight_layout()\n```\n\n\n    \n![png](07_notes_files/07_notes_17_0.png)\n    \n\n\nSo we see that for small initial conditions, we recover the SHO. But for most initial conditions, we have oscillations that are not sinusoidal. Moreover, we have a series of high energy trajectories that are not bounded. These are the ones that continue to allow the pendulum to rotate over the top of itself. This is a new type of motion that we did not see in the SHO.\n\n## What about damped motion?\n\nWe can also consider the case where we add a damping term to the pendulum equation of motion:\n\n$$\\ddot{x} = -\\sin x - \\gamma \\dot{x}.$$\n\nOr in the approximate form:\n\n$$\\ddot{x} = - x - \\gamma \\dot{x}.$$\n\nIn either case, we can write this as two first order equations:\n\n**Exact Form**\n\n$$\\dot{x} = v,$$\n$$\\dot{v} = -\\sin x - \\gamma v.$$\n\n**Approximate Form**\n\n$$\\dot{x} = v,$$\n$$\\dot{v} = -x - \\gamma v.$$\n\nWhen we plot this phase portrait we will find a new type of motion and a new type of critical point -- an attractor. This is a point in phase space that all trajectories will eventually approach. We leave that plot as an exercise.\n\n\n"

        "# Week 8 - Oscillations\n\nOscillatory or periodic behavior is a common phenomenon in nature. We see it in the motion of pendulums, springs, and other mechanical systems. But oscillations are not limited to mechanical systems; they can also be found in electrical circuits, biological systems, and even in the behavior of populations in ecology. The study of periodic motion is foundational to the understanding of many physical systems because many present themselves with local minima in their potential energy. Alternatively, some systems are confined in ways that lead to periodic motion. \n\nThe most common of these is the simple harmonic oscillator, which is a system that experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement from equilibrium. The motion of that system is not just periodic, but sinusoidal, a particular kind of periodicity in which we obtain a sinusoidal function with very nice properties.\n\n## Reminder of the SHO\n\nThe simple harmonic oscillator (SHO) is a system that experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement from equilibrium. The equation of motion for a simple harmonic oscillator is given by:\n\n$$m\\ddot{x} = -k x.$$\n\nThe associated potential energy is given by:\n\n$$U(x) = \\frac{1}{2} k x^2 + U_0.$$\n\nIt is this potential energy that leads to not only peridioc motion, but the sinusoidal nature of the motion. And because the approximation near a local minimum often yields a quadratic potential to leading order, \n\n$$U(x) \\propto x^2,$$\n\nwe can use the SHO to approximate many systems. The solution to the SHO is well-established, and we can write the position of the oscillator as a function of time. We know there are several forms of the solution that are all valid, but they must have two free parameters to match the initial conditions. \n\n$$x(t) = A \\cos(\\omega t) + B \\sin(\\omega t),$$\n$$x(t) = C \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi),$$\n$$x(t) = C_1 e^{i \\omega t} + C_2 e^{-i \\omega t}.$$\n\n## Nonlinear oscillators\n\nWhile the SHO is a well known and well-studied system, many systems are not simple harmonic oscillators. In fact, most systems are not simple harmonic oscillators. The potential energy of a system can be more complicated than a simple quadratic function. For example, the potential energy of a pendulum is given by:\n\n$$U(\\theta) = mgL(1 - \\cos(\\theta)).$$\n\nThe general motion of a pendulum is thus not simple harmonic motion, but it can be approximated as simple harmonic motion for small angles. \n\nThere are other examples:\n\n* The [Duffing Oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duffing_oscillator) is a nonlinear oscillator that can exhibit chaotic behavior. Typically it is driven by an external force, which can be periodic or random. The driven Duffing oscillator is given by:\n\n$$\\ddot{x} + \\delta \\dot{x} + \\alpha x + \\beta x^3 = F_0 \\cos(\\omega t)$$\n\n* The [Van der Pol Oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Pol_oscillator) is a nonlinear oscillator that can exhibit [limit cycle behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_cycle). \n\n$$\\ddot{x} - \\mu(1-x^2)\\dot{x} + x = 0$$\n\n* It can also be driven by an external force:\n\n$$\\ddot{x} - \\mu(1-x^2)\\dot{x} + x - A \\sin(\\omega t)$$\n\nAll of the tools we develop to investigate the SHO can be ported to these systems.\n\n## Synchronization (21 minute video)\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of an oscillator is that they can couple to each other. This leads to things like [beats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_(acoustics)), where two oscillators with slightly different frequencies can create a new frequency that is the difference of the two. This is a common phenomenon in music, where two instruments playing slightly out of tune can create a new frequency that is the difference of the two.\n\nBut even more interesting is the phenomenon of [synchronization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronization). \n\nHow do fireflies end up blinking together? How do walking people end up moving in step? How does your heart physically push blood through your body? \n\nEach of these questions has to do with the physics of [synchronization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronization). There's a lot of interesting physics in this space. The phenomenon of synchronization is rooted in the physics of [oscillations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillation) and [waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave). \n\nWhen oscillators couple (or influence each other), we begin to see behavior that is more complex than the sole oscillator. These \"coupled oscillators\" can demonstrate a wide variety of behaviors, including synchronization. They also form the basis for important technologies like [lasers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser) and [radio transmitters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_transmitter).\n\n We will begin our study of oscillations with the [simple harmonic oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_harmonic_motion), then we add a little [damping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping) to the system, and then move to more complex systems (e.g., [the Duffing oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duffing_equation)).\n\n The video below is a good introduction to the topic of synchronization and worth a watch. \n\n[![The Surprising Secret of Synchronization](../images/notes/week8/t-_VPRCtiUg.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-_VPRCtiUg)\n\n\n"

        "# Week 8 - Notes: Oscillators and Modeling Oscillations\n\n\nWe continue our study of physics phenomena that exhibits recurrent or periodic behavior. Some systems repeat their motion in a regular pattern, and we call them oscillators. \n\nWe have met this behavior many times. This is because we often look at the behavior of stems just a little bit away from equilibrium. Systems with local stable equilibria will have oscillatory behavior in a region around that equilibrium point. Note below the made up example of a potential energy function that has local minima and maxima.\n\nNear the local minima, the system will oscillate back and forth. The potential energy function will look like a parabola.\n\n\n```python\n## Make a plot of a potential energy function with 3 local minima\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8-colorblind')\n\nx = np.linspace(-2, 2, 100)\nU = x**6 - 2*x**3 - 10*x**2 + x\n\nplt.plot(x, U)\nplt.xlabel('x')\nplt.ylabel('Potential Energy')\nplt.title('Potential Energy Function')\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n```\n\n\n    \n![png](08_notes_files/08_notes_1_0.png)\n    \n\n\n## Why do we often see oscillations in physics?\n\nOscillatory behavior is common in physics because many systems have a stable equilibrium point. When we disturb the system from equilibrium, it will oscillate back and forth around that equilibrium point. Let's assume there's a given stable equilibrium point at $x=a$, we can write the potential energy function as a Taylor series expansion around that point:\n\n$$U(x) \\approx U(a) + \\dfrac{dU}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=a}(x-a) + \\dfrac{1}{2}\\dfrac{d^2U}{dx^2}\\bigg|_{x=a}(x-a)^2 + \\cdots$$\n\nThe linear term is zero because the equilibrium point is a minimum, $\\dfrac{dU}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=a}=0$. The quadratic term is remains as does the constant term. So up to the quadratic term, the potential energy function is a parabola.\n\n$$U(x) \\approx U(a) + \\dfrac{1}{2}\\dfrac{d^2U}{dx^2}\\bigg|_{x=a}(x-a)^2$$\n\nWe can write the value of the second derivative as a constant $k$. It will just be the measure of the concavity of the potential energy function at the equilibrium point. So near $x=a$, the potential energy function will look like a parabola of the form:\n\n$$U(x) \\approx U(a) + \\dfrac{1}{2}k(x-a)^2$$\n\nBecause only changes in potential energy are important, we can ignore the constant term $U(a)$. The change in potential energy is then:\n\n$$\\Delta U = \\dfrac{1}{2}k(x_f-a)^2 - \\dfrac{1}{2}k(x_i-a)^2$$\n$$\\Delta U = U_f - U_i$$\n\nThis is just the change in potential energy for any spring-mass system (any SHO) if $k>0$.\n\n## The Exact Solution for the Simple Harmonic Oscillator\n\nThis potential $U=\\frac{1}{2}kx^2$ is the potential for the simple harmonic oscillator when $k>0$ and we are modeling around a stable critical point. We know that this potential energy will produce a restoring force.\n\n$$F = -\\dfrac{dU}{dx} = -kx$$\n\nThus our equation of motion is:\n\n$$m\\ddot{x} = -kx,$$\n\nOr\n\n$$\\ddot{x} = -\\dfrac{k}{m}x.$$\n\nThe natural oscillation frequency of the SHO is:\n\n$$\\omega = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{k}{m}}.$$\n\nAnd thus we obtain several forms of their general solution:\n\n$$x(t) = A\\cos(\\omega t) + B\\sin(\\omega t)$$\n$$x(t) = C\\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)$$\n$$x(t) = D\\sin(\\omega t + \\phi)$$\n\nWhere $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $\\phi$ are constants that depend on the initial conditions of the system. The phase $\\phi$ is the phase angle of the oscillation. Each solution is equivalent to the others and can be written as the other form. And each solution has two arbitrary constants that depend on the initial conditions of the system.\n\n### Complex forms of the SHO solution\n\nThese forms are useful, but often lead to more complex algebra. We can write the solution in terms of complex exponentials, which have the advantage of simplifying the algebra. Let's try a complex form of the solution:\n\n$$x(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\;\\textrm{where}\\;i^2=-1$$\n\nTake its derivatives:\n\n$$\\dot{x}(t) = i\\omega e^{i\\omega t}$$\n$$\\ddot{x}(t) = (i\\omega)(i\\omega) e^{i\\omega t} = -\\omega^2 e^{i\\omega t} = -\\omega^2 x(t)$$\n\nNote that $e^{-i\\omega t}$ is also a solution to the differential equation that will produce this same result. So the general solution is the linear combination of these two solutions:\n\n$$x(t) = C_1 e^{i\\omega t} + C_2 e^{-i\\omega t}$$\n\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants that depend on the initial conditions of the system and **can be complex**. We still have two arbitrary constants that depend on the initial conditions of the system, which is needed for a second-order differential equation.\n\n### But the solution to the motion of the SHO is real!\n\nYes, that is true. The solution must be a real function of time. This puts conditions on the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$. Using the Euler formula:\n\n$$e^{i\\theta} = \\cos(\\theta) + i\\sin(\\theta)$$\n\nwe can apply this to the functional form of the solution, such that,\n\n$$e^{\\pm i\\omega t} = \\cos(\\omega t) \\pm i\\sin(\\omega t).$$\n\nApplying this to the general solution:\n\n$$x(t) = C_1(\\cos(\\omega t) + i\\sin(\\omega t)) + C_2(\\cos(\\omega t) - i\\sin(\\omega t))$$\n$$x(t) = (C_1 + C_2)\\cos(\\omega t) + i(C_1 - C_2)\\sin(\\omega t).$$\n\nWe grouped the terms in the last line to define some constants $B_1$ and $B_2$:\n\n$$B_1 = C_1 + C_2$$\n$$B_2 = i(C_1 - C_2)$$\n\nSo that,\n\n$$x(t) = B_1\\cos(\\omega t) + B_2\\sin(\\omega t).$$\n\nBut $B_1$ and $B_2$ must be real because the rest of the solution is real.  What does that mean? Let's write $C_1$ and $C_2$ in terms of $B_1$ and $B_2$:\n\n$$C_1 = \\dfrac{1}{2}\\left(B_1-iB_2\\right)$$\n$$C_2 = \\dfrac{1}{2}\\left(B_1+iB_2\\right)$$\n\n\n\n## Complex Conjugates\n\nThese values of $C_1$ and $C_2$ are the complex conjugates of each other. The complex conjugate of a complex number $z=a+ib$ is $z^*=a-ib$. The complex conjugate of a complex number is the same as the original number, but with the sign of the imaginary part reversed.\n\nWe can draw these in the complex plane where the $x$-axis is the real part and the $y$-axis is the imaginary part.\n\n![Complex Conjugates](../images/notes/week8/conjugates_graph.png)\n\nIn the graph we can see that the complex conjugates are a reflection of each other. This is because the imaginary part of the complex conjugate is the negative of the original imaginary part.\n\nThe mathematics is quite useful for us. Consider the produce of two complex conjugates:\n\n$$z = a + ib$$\n$$z^* = a - ib$$\n\nSo that,\n\n$$zz^* = (a+ib)(a-ib) = a^2 + b^2$$\n\nThe product of a complex number and its complex conjugate is always a real number. Moreover, we can define the magnitude of a complex number as:\n\n$$|z| = \\sqrt{zz^*} = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2},m$$\n\nwhich is also real! Given that $C_1$ and $C_2$ are complex conjugates ($C_2 = C_1^*$), we can write the general solution to the SHO as:\n\n$$x(t) = C_1 e^{i\\omega t} + C_1^* e^{-i\\omega t}$$\n\n### What does that mean for the SHO?\n\nThere's a few more mathematical properties for complex conjugates that are useful for the SHO. The general solution to the SHO is. Let:\n\n$$z = a + ib$$\n$$z^* = a - ib$$\n\nSo that,\n\n$$z+z^* = 2a,$$\n$$z-z^* = 2ib.$$\n\nWe denote the Real Part of a complex number as $Re(z)$ and the Imaginary Part as $Im(z)$. So that,\n\n$$Re(z) = Re(z^*) = a,$$\n$$Im(z) = -Im(z^*) = b.$$\n\nThe real and imaginary parts of a complex number are real numbers. We can apply these properties to the general solution of the SHO:\n\n$$x(t) = C_1 e^{i\\omega t} + C_1^* e^{-i\\omega t}$$\n$$x(t) = C_1 e^{i\\omega t} + \\left(C_1 e^{i\\omega t}\\right)^*$$\n$$x(t) = 2Re\\left(C_1 e^{i\\omega t}\\right)$$\n\nlet $C = 2C_1$ so that,\n\n$$x(t) = Re\\left(C e^{i\\omega t}\\right).$$\n\nThis must be equal to a real function of time. For example,\n\n$$x(t)= A\\cos(\\omega t-\\delta),$$\n\nwhich we can write as,\n\n$$x(t) = Re\\left(Ae^{i(\\omega t - \\delta)}\\right) = Re\\left(Ae^{-i\\delta}e^{i\\omega t}\\right).$$\n\nThus, \n\n$$C = Ae^{-i\\delta}.$$\n\nThis is a bit abstract, but let's try to graph this and make it a bit concrete. Below, we've plotted the solution to an oscillator that starts with a $\\delta = \\pi/4$ phase shift. The solution is plotted in the complex plane with rainbow colors to demonstrate time (from violet to red). The starting point is marked with a black square, and because the $omega$ is positive, the solution moves counter-clockwise in the plane.\n\nBelow that we trace the real part of the solution in the $t$-$x$ plane. This is not the same as a readout on something like an oscilloscope, or a time trace of the solution. But we can rotate the graph to be in the $x$-$t$ plane - and thus a real temporal solution. In all cases, the black square marks the starting point of the solution, and the rainbow of points marks the solution as it moves in time. \n\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib import cm\n\nplt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8-colorblind')\n\nC1 = 1\ndelta = np.pi/4\nomega = 1\nt = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 100)\n\nx = C1*np.exp(1j*(omega*t - delta))\n\n## Plot the trajectory in the complex plane\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1,1, figsize=(6, 6))\nplt.scatter(x.real, x.imag, c=t, cmap=cm.rainbow, s=15)\nplt.plot(x.real[0], x.imag[0], 'ks', markersize=15, label='Start')\nplt.axhline(0, color='k', lw=2)\nplt.axvline(0, color='k', lw=2)\nplt.grid()\nplt.xlabel('Real Part')\nplt.ylabel('Imaginary Part')\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n## Plot the trajectory in the t-x plane\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1,1, figsize=(6, 6))\nplt.scatter(x.real, t, c=t, cmap=cm.rainbow, s=15, label='Real Part')\nplt.plot(x.real[0], t[0], 'ks', markersize=15, label='Start')\nplt.axvline(0, color='k', lw=2)\nplt.grid()\nplt.xlabel('x')\nplt.ylabel('t', rotation=0)\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n# Plot the trajectory in the x-t plane\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1,1, figsize=(6, 6))\nplt.scatter(t, x.real, c=t, cmap=cm.rainbow, s=15, label='Real Part')\nplt.plot(t[0], x.real[0], 'ks', markersize=15, label='Start')\nplt.axhline(0, color='k', lw=2)\nplt.grid()\nplt.xlabel('t')\nplt.ylabel('x', rotation=0)\nplt.tight_layout()\n```\n\n\n    \n![png](08_notes_files/08_notes_6_0.png)\n    \n\n\n\n    \n![png](08_notes_files/08_notes_6_1.png)\n    \n\n\n\n    \n![png](08_notes_files/08_notes_6_2.png)\n    \n\n\n## Damped Oscillations\n\nThe firs complication we can add to an oscillator is a bit of damping, or friction. It's common to see this in real systems. Here, we add a force that removes energy from the system. This is often modeled as a force that is proportional to the velocity of the system:\n$$F_{damping} = -b\\dot{x}$$\n\nwhere $b$ is a constant that depends on the system. The equation of motion is then:\n\n$$m\\ddot{x} = -kx - b\\dot{x}$$\nor, rearranging terms,\n\n$$m\\ddot{x} + b\\dot{x} + kx = 0$$\n\n### Common simplifications\n\nWe often rewrite the equation in terms of $\\ddot{x}$:\n\n$$\\ddot{x} + \\dfrac{b}{m}\\dot{x} + \\dfrac{k}{m}x = 0$$\n\nAnd then we define a few constants:\n\n$$\\omega_0 = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{k}{m}} \\text{ (natural frequency)}$$\n$$2\\beta = \\dfrac{b}{m} \\text{ (damping constant)}$$\n\nThus we obtain:\n\n$$\\ddot{x} + 2\\beta\\dot{x} + \\omega_0^2 x = 0$$\n\nThis is a second order, linear ODE, so if we find a solution, and it first our initial conditions, we can be sure it is the solution to the problem.\n\n:::{admonition} Uniqueness of the solution\n:class: tip\n\nLinear ODEs have a very nice property: if you find a solution to the ODE, and it satisfies the initial conditions, then it is the unique solution to the problem. This stems from the [Picard-Lindel\u00f6f theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picard%E2%80%93Lindel%C3%B6f_theorem).\n\nThat is you are guaranteed that if you find a solution, you can be sure it is the only solution.\n\nThere's a caveat to this, if you find multiple solutions and they are different, then your solution is the linear combination of those solutions.\n\nWe will exploit this property frequently.\n:::\n\n### Finding the solution\n\nLet's assume a solution of the form and see where that gets us:\n\n$$x(t) = e^{r t}$$\n\nSo that the derivatives are:\n\n$$\\dot{x}(t) = r e^{r t} \\qquad \\ddot{x}(t) = r^2 e^{r t}$$\n\nSubstituting these into the ODE gives us:\n\n$$r^2 e^{r t} + 2\\beta r e^{r t} + \\omega_0^2 e^{r t} = 0$$\n\nWe can factor out the $e^{r t}$ term:\n\n$$e^{r t} \\left(r^2 + 2\\beta r + \\omega_0^2\\right) = 0$$\n\nExcept for the trivial case of $e^{r t} = 0$, we can divide both sides by $e^{r t}$:\n\n$$r^2 + 2\\beta r + \\omega_0^2 = 0$$\n\nThis is the so called [Auxilary Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxiliary_equation). This is a quadratic equation in $r$ and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\n$$r = \\dfrac{-2\\beta \\pm \\sqrt{(2\\beta)^2 - 4\\omega_0^2}}{2}$$\n\nSo that we obtain two roots:\n\n$$r_1 = -\\beta + \\sqrt{\\beta^2 - \\omega_0^2}$$\n$$r_2 = -\\beta - \\sqrt{\\beta^2 - \\omega_0^2}$$\n\nAs uniqueness guides us, we can write the general solution as a linear combination of the two solutions:\n\n$$x(t) = A e^{r_1 t} + B e^{r_2 t}$$\n\nWhere $A$ and $B$ are constants that depend on the initial conditions of the system.\n\nIn full detail that solution is:\n\n$$x(t) = e^{-\\beta t}\\left(A e^{\\sqrt{\\beta^2 - \\omega_0^2} t} + B e^{-\\sqrt{\\beta^2 - \\omega_0^2} t}\\right).$$\n\n## Case Studies of Damped Oscillations\n\nLet's look a the three cases of damping. We can classify the system based on the value of $\\beta$ and $\\omega_0$.\n\n### No Damping $\\beta=0$\n\nThis is just the case of the SHO. The solution is:\n\n$$x(t) = e^{-\\beta t}\\left(A e^{\\sqrt{\\beta^2 - \\omega_0^2} t} + B e^{-\\sqrt{\\beta^2 - \\omega_0^2} t}\\right).$$\n\n$$x(t) = e^0 \\left(A e^{\\sqrt{-\\omega^2} t} + B e^{\\sqrt{-\\omega^2 t}}\\right)$$\n\n$$x(t) = C_1 e^{i\\omega t} + C_2 e^{-i\\omega t}$$\n\nThis is the same solution we had before. The system oscillates with a frequency $\\omega_0$ and the amplitude is constant.\n\n### Weak Damping $\\beta^2 < \\omega_0^2$\n\nTechnically, weak means $\\beta^2 \\ll \\omega_0^2$, but whatever. Let's just work this out:\n\n$$\\beta^2 - \\omega_0^2 < 0$$\n\nSo that\n\n$$\\sqrt{\\beta^2 - \\omega_0^2} = i\\sqrt{\\omega_0^2 - \\beta^2} = i\\omega_1.$$\n\nWe introduce a new frequency $\\omega_1 = \\sqrt{\\omega_0^2 - \\beta^2}$, which is different from the natural frequency $\\omega_0$. The solution is:\n\n$$x(t) = e^{-\\beta t}\\left(C_1 e^{\\sqrt{\\beta^2 - \\omega_0^2} t} + C_2 e^{-\\sqrt{\\beta^2 - \\omega_0^2} t}\\right)$$\n\nSo that with a change to $\\omega_1$ we have:\n\n$$x(t) = e^{-\\beta t}\\left(C_1 e^{i\\omega_1 t} + C_2 e^{-i\\omega_1 t}\\right)$$\n\nOr an equivalent form:\n\n$$x(t) = Ae^{-\\beta t}\\cos(\\omega_1 t + \\delta)$$\n\nThis is an oscillator with a decay envelope that is decaying according to the factor $e^{-\\beta t}$. We can graph it.\n\nThis is what we call an underdamped oscillator. The system oscillates with a frequency $\\omega_1$ and the amplitude decays exponentially with time.\n\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8-colorblind')\n\nA = 1\nbeta = 0.5\nomega = 10\nomega1 = np.sqrt(omega**2 - beta**2)\nt = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 1000)\nx = A*np.exp(-beta*t)*np.cos(omega1*t)\nupper_envelope = A*np.exp(-beta*t)\nlower_envelope = -A*np.exp(-beta*t)\n\nplt.plot(t, x, 'C0', label='Underdamped Oscillation')\nplt.plot(t, upper_envelope, 'C1--', label='Upper Envelope')\nplt.plot(t, lower_envelope, 'C1--', label='Lower Envelope')\nplt.axhline(0, color='k', lw=2)\nplt.xlabel('Time')\nplt.ylabel('Displacement')\nplt.title('Damped Oscillation with Decay Envelope shown')\n#plt.legend()\nplt.grid()\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n```\n\n\n    \n![png](08_notes_files/08_notes_9_0.png)\n    \n\n\n### Strong Damping $\\beta^2 > \\omega_0^2$\n\nAgain, the assumption is really $\\beta^2 \\gg \\omega_0^2$, but let's just work this out. In the case of strong damping, we have:\n\n$$\\beta^2 - \\omega_0^2 > 0$$\n\nSo that $\\sqrt{\\beta^2 - \\omega_0^2}$ is a real number. We can write the solution as:\n\n$$x(t) = C_1 e^{(-\\beta - \\sqrt{\\beta^2 - \\omega_0^2})t} + C_2 e^{(-\\beta + \\sqrt{\\beta^2 - \\omega_0^2})t}$$\n\nLet's consider $t \\rightarrow \\infty$. Both terms will decay to zero. This is overdamped motion. And typically there's a transient motion that quickly decays to zero. The system does not oscillate, but rather returns to equilibrium without oscillating. Let's graph it.\n\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8-colorblind')\n\nC1 = 1\nC2 = -1\nomega = 10\nbeta = 100\n\nt = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 1000)\n\nx = C1*np.exp(-1*(beta-np.sqrt(beta**2 - omega**2))*t) + C2*np.exp(-1*(beta+np.sqrt(beta**2 - omega**2))*t)\n\nplt.plot(t, x, 'C0', label='Overdamped Oscillation')\nplt.grid()\nplt.axhline(0, color='k', lw=2)\nplt.xlabel('Time')\nplt.ylabel('Displacement')\nplt.title('Overdamped Oscillation')\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n```\n\n\n    \n![png](08_notes_files/08_notes_11_0.png)\n    \n\n\n### Critical Damping $\\beta^2 = \\omega_0^2$\n\nThis is the case where we naively would find:\n\n$$\\sqrt{\\beta^2 - \\omega_0^2} = 0$$\n\nso that,\n\n$$x(t) \\propto e^{-\\beta t}$$\n\nSo the solution just decays to zero??\n\nNo! Our guess of $x(t) = e^{r t}$ is only a good guess unless $\\beta = \\omega_0$. In this case, we have a double root. We need to find a new solution. We can do this by multiplying our guess by $t$:\n$$x(t) = t e^{-\\beta t}$$\n\nSo the general solution is for critical damping is:\n\n$$x(t) = e^{-\\beta t}\\left(C_1 + C_2 t\\right)$$\n\nAnd we plot that below.\n\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8-colorblind')\n\nC1 = 1\nC2 = -1\nomega = 1\nbeta = 1\n\nt = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 1000)\nx = np.exp(-beta*t)*(C1 + C2*t)\n\nplt.plot(t, x, 'C0', label='Critically Damped Oscillation')\nplt.axhline(0, color='k', lw=2)\nplt.xlabel('Time')\nplt.ylabel('Displacement')\nplt.title('Critically Damped Oscillation')\nplt.grid()\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n```\n\n\n    \n![png](08_notes_files/08_notes_13_0.png)\n    \n\n"

        "# Week 9 - Driven Oscillators and Resonance\n\nThus far, we have either worked with energy conserving systems or systems that dissipate energy to the point of stopping their motion. The primary examples have been conservative systems, potential energy oscillators, and systems with damping that extract all the kinetic energy from the system. [Driven Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driven_oscillator) are systems that are driven by external forcing. We use \"forcing\" because it's not always a push or a pull. Radio systems use electromagnetic waves to drive the system. Climate systems are driven by thermal forcing. \n\nDriven oscillators are a specific type of driven system, we expect them to demonstrate recurrent bahevior. Driven ooscillators are quite common. Analog radios use a driven oscillator that is tuned to a specific frequency (99.5 FM is tuned to 99.5 MHz). When you dial the radio you are \"tuning\" the oscillator to the frequency of the broadcast. This is an illustration of the phenomenon of [resonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance). Resonance is a phenomenon where a system is driven at a frequency that matches (or closely matches) its natural frequency. When this happens, the amplitude of the oscillation can grow very large. Resonance is the phenomenon that caused the [collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacoma_Narrows_Bridge_(1940)) in 1940. \n\n## Collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge (9 minute video)\n\nResonance is the phenomenon that caused the [collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacoma_Narrows_Bridge_(1940)) in 1940. The video below describes the collapse and how the bridge was rebuilt to avoid the same problem. \n\n[![Why the Tacoma Narrows Bridge Collapsed](../images/notes/week9/mXTSnZgrfxM.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXTSnZgrfxM)\n\n## Quantum Mechanical Resonance\n\nYou might have heard about resonance in the context of [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance_(quantum_mechanics)) or most likely in [particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics) or [nuclear physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_physics). In these cases, typically resonance is a phenomenon where a system is driven at a frequency that matches some natural spacing of energy levels. In quantum mechanics, frequency of light is related to it's energy by $E = h \\nu$, where $h$ is Planck's constant and $\\nu$ is the frequency of the light. \n\nThe energy levels of a system are quantized, they are separated by discrete amounts. When a system is driven at a frequency that matches the energy level separation, the system can absorb energy from the driving force. This can cause the system to transition to a higher energy state. A quantum system also ejects an amount of energy as a photon (randomly) and transitions to a lower energy state.  \n\nProbing these transitions can tell you about particle properties and reactions. This is a large field of study in particle and nuclear physics.\n\n## Solving Linear Differential Equations\n\nMuch of the work we have done so far has been solving homogeneous linear differential equations. These are equations that have a form like this:\n\n$$\\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} + 2\\beta\\frac{dx}{dt} + \\omega_0^2 x = 0.$$\n\nAll of the driven systems that we will work with will be described by a linear differential equation. The general form of a linear differential equation is:\n\n$$\\frac{d^n x}{dt^n} + a_{n-1} \\frac{d^{n-1} x}{dt^{n-1}} + a_{n-2} \\frac{d^{n-2} x}{dt^{n-2}} + ... + a_1 \\frac{dx}{dt} + a_0 x = f(t).$$\n\nThe $f(t)$ is the driving force. The $a_i$ are constants. The $n$ is the order of the differential equation.\n\nWe've never solved a driven differential equation before, but we have two powerful tools: superposition and uniqueness. Superposition tells us that we can solve the homogeneous part of the equation and then add a particular solution to get the full solution. Uniqueness tells us that if we have a solution that fits the driver and the initial conditions, then it is unique. \n\nAs the homogenous solutions for our oscillators will typically die out, we will refer to them as transient solutions. The particular solution will be the steady state solution.\n\n\n"

        "# Week 9 - Notes: Driven Oscillations\n\nWe have seen that oscillators that have only a potential energy term will oscillate forever -- energy is conserved. While the oscillations can take any shape, they are periodic. \n\nDamped oscillators dissipate energy, and so the oscillations will eventually die out. With the damped harmonic oscillator, the oscillations are still periodic, but the amplitude decreases over time. For that model,\n\n$$\\ddot{x} + 2\\beta \\dot{x} + \\omega_0^2 x = 0$$\n\nwe found that the relative strengths of $\\beta$ and $\\omega_0$ determined the type of oscillation. But the motion always died out because the damping removed energy from the system.\n\n**What if we kept putting energy into the system?**\n\nWe can replenish the energy that is lost to damping by adding a driving force. These are driven oscillators, sometimes called forced oscillators. The driving force is a time dependent force that is added to the system.\n\n\n:::{admonition} Time Dependent Force Not Periodic\n:class : tip\n\nHere we used time dependent force to mean a force that depends on nearly any function of time $F(t)$. The force does not have to be perdiodic, but it can be. \n\nSystems can be given a kick or pulse of energy (which we might model with a [delta function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_function) or a [step function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaviside_step_function), or they can be driven by a periodic force.\n\nFor most of our examples, we will use a periodic driving force.\n:::\n\n## Driving the Oscillator\n\nFor the damped harmonic oscillator, we had\n$$m\\ddot{x} + b \\dot{x} + k x = 0$$\n\nNow we will add a driving force $F(t)$ to the system, so that the equation of motion becomes\n$$m\\ddot{x} +b \\dot{x} + k x = F(t)$$\n\nWe can represent that setup in the picture below. The blue spring with spring constant $k$ is attached to a red mass $m$. There is a dashpot (damping) in green with damping constant $b=2\\beta$. The driving force $F(t)$ is shown in black and called \"driver\".\n\n![driven oscillator](../images/notes/week9/driven_oscillator.png)\n\nWe write that differential equation as:\n\n$$\\ddot{x} + 2\\beta \\dot{x} + \\omega_0^2 x = F(t)/m=f(t)$$\n\nwhere $\\omega_0^2 = k/m$ and $2\\beta = b/m$. The function $f(t)$ is the driving force per unit mass.\n\n**Note that this differential equation remains linear.**\n\nWhy? Because the \"operations\" on x(t) are linear.\n\n## Linearity of Differential Equations\n\nA linear differential equation has many nice properties. In particular, the superposition of solutions and the uniqueness of solutions. So it is worth knowing when you have one.\n\n**Claim:** $\\dfrac{d}{dt}$ is a linear operator.\n\nWhat is an operator? It is simply a function that takes a function as an input and returns another function as an output. The derivative is a function that takes a function and returns another function, namely the slope of the tangent line to the original function everywhere it is defined and differentiable.\n\nLet's prove that $\\dfrac{d}{dt}$ is a linear operator. \n\nLet $x(t) = x_1(t) + x_2(t)$, where $x_1(t)$ and $x_2(t)$ are two functions. Then\n\n$$\\dfrac{dx(t)}{dt} = \\dfrac{d}{dt} \\left(x_1(t) + x_2(t)\\right) = \\dfrac{dx_1(t)}{dt} + \\dfrac{dx_2(t)}{dt}$$\n\nWe can distribute the derivative across the sum of the two functions. Thus $\\dfrac{d}{dt}$ is a linear operator.\n\nThis also suggests that constants and other simple derivatives are linear operators (e.g., $\\dfrac{d^2}{dt^2}$ and $\\dfrac{d^3}{dt^3}$). And because of the distributive property, any linear sum of linear operators is also a linear operator (e.g., $\\dfrac{d^2}{dt^2} + \\dfrac{d}{dt}$).\n\nWe can write the diffferential equation for the driven oscillator as\n\n$$\\dfrac{d^2x(t)}{dt^2} + 2\\beta \\dfrac{dx(t)}{dt} + \\omega_0^2 x(t) = f(t).$$\n\nWe group the terms of the left hand side into a single operator, $\\mathcal{D}$, so that\n\n$$\\mathcal{D} x(t) = \\left(\\dfrac{d^2}{dt^2} + 2\\beta \\dfrac{d}{dt} + \\omega_0^2\\right) x(t) = f(t)$$\n\nThe operator $\\mathcal{D}$ is a linear differential operator. This compact notation expresses the linearity of the differential equation.\n\n$$\\mathcal{D} x(t) = f(t)$$\n\n### Effect of a Linear Operator on our Solutions\n\nBecause $\\mathcal{D}$ is a linear operator, we can distribute it. This results in our finding a linear combination of solutions to the differential equation. This is built up quite easily in three steps.\n\n1. We can allow the operator to act on a function scaled by a scalar constant $a$: \n\n$$\\mathcal{D} \\left(a x(t)\\right) = a \\mathcal{D} x(t)$$\n\n2. We can allow the operator to act on a sum of functions:\n\n$$\\mathcal{D} \\left(x_1(t) + x_2(t)\\right) = \\mathcal{D} x_1(t) + \\mathcal{D} x_2(t)$$\n\n3. We can allow the operator to act on a linear combination of functions:\n\n$$\\mathcal{D} \\left(a x_1(t) + b x_2(t)\\right) = a \\mathcal{D} x_1(t) + b \\mathcal{D} x_2(t)$$\n\nThis is the superposition principle in action. But we have to be careful when we apply it. For example, when,\n\n$$\\mathcal{D} x(t) = f(t)$$\n\nwe must first solve the homogeneous equation, $\\mathcal{D} x(t) = 0$.\n\n## Homogeneous and Particular Solutions\n\nThe damped driven oscillator is a linear differential equation. But that means that any solution to the equation where the driving force is zero is a solution to the equation where the driving force is non-zero. And, thus must be added to the solution of the non-homogeneous equation. \n\nLet's use the language of differential operators to express this. We want to solve:\n\n$$\\mathcal{D} x(t) = f(t)$$\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{D}$ is a linear differential operator. But any solution to the homogeneous equation, $\\mathcal{D} x_h(t) = 0$, is a solution to the non-homogeneous equation. \n\nWe use the notation $x_h(t)$ to denote the solution to the homogeneous equation.\n\nSo let's use the superposition principle to write the solution to the non-homogeneous equation as a sum of two parts:\n\n$$x(t) = x_h(t) + x_p(t)$$\n\nwhere $x_p(t)$ is a particular solution to the non-homogeneous equation. We will get to the name of $x_p(t)$ in a moment. Let's the focus on the mathematical properties of the solution for a moment.\n\n$$\\mathcal{D} x(t) = \\underbrace{\\mathcal{D} x_h(t)}_0 + \\mathcal{D} x_p(t) = f(t)$$\n\nWith the homogeneous solution, $\\mathcal{D} x_h(t) = 0$, we have\n\n$$\\mathcal{D} x_p(t) = f(t)$$\n\nThat is what defines the particular solution. In our case, that it is specific to the driving force $f(t)$ we have chosen.\n\n**Summary:** When solving $\\mathcal{D} x(t) = f(t)$, the solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution $x_h(t)$ and a particular solution $x_p(t)$. We typically solve the homogeneous equation $\\mathcal{D} x_h(t) = 0$ first. \n\nThe solutions $x_h(t)$ satisfies the unknowns set by the initial conditions. The particular solution $x_p(t)$ is a solution to the non-homogeneous equation $\\mathcal{D} x_p(t) = f(t)$, so it will not depend on the initial conditions, how it is particular to the driving force $f(t)$.\n\n## Example: Sinusoidal Driving Force\n\nLet's consider a sinusoidal driving force. We will use the following notation for the driving force:\n\n$$f(t) = f_0 \\cos(\\omega t)$$\n\nwhere $f_0$ is the amplitude of the driving force and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of the driving force. **Note that $\\omega$ is not necessarily the same as $\\omega_0$.**\n\nSo we can write the differential equation for the driven oscillator as\n\n$$\\mathcal{D} x(t) = f_0 \\cos(\\omega t)$$\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{D}$ is the linear differential operator\n\n$$\\mathcal{D} = \\dfrac{d^2}{dt^2} + 2\\beta \\dfrac{d}{dt} + \\omega_0^2$$\n\nNote that if instead $f(t) = f_0 \\sin(\\omega t)$, then we would have\n\n$$\\mathcal{D} y(t) = f_0 \\sin(\\omega t)$$\n\nwhere $y(t)$ is the solution to the differential equation with a sine driving force and $\\mathcal{D}$ is the same linear differential operator. Writing both the $x(t)$ of $y(t)$ differential equations out, we have\n\n$$\\ddot{x} + 2\\beta \\dot{x} + \\omega_0^2 x = f_0 \\cos(\\omega t)$$\n$$\\ddot{y} + 2\\beta \\dot{y} + \\omega_0^2 y = f_0 \\sin(\\omega t)$$\n\n### Two Birds, One Stone\n\nWe can cleverly combine these two equations into a singlle differential equation by using complex numbers.\n\n$$z(t) = x(t) + i y(t).$$\n\nWe can similarly write $f(t)$ as a complex sum:\n\n$$f(t) = f_0 \\cos(\\omega t) + i f_0 \\sin(\\omega t) = f_0 e^{i \\omega t}.$$\n\nNow because of linearity, we can write the differential equation for $z(t)$ as\n\n$$\\mathcal{D} z(t) = f_0 e^{i \\omega t}.$$\n\nWritten out, we have\n\n$$\\ddot{z} + 2\\beta \\dot{z} + \\omega_0^2 z = f_0 e^{i \\omega t}.$$\n\n### Particular Solution\n\nWe note the particular solution depends on the driving force. We can try one that follows the complex exponential form of the driving force.\n\n$$z_p(t) = C e^{i \\omega t}$$\n\nwhere $C$ is a complex constant. We can find $C$ by substituting $z_p(t)$ into the differential equation.\n\n\n$$\\ddot{z}_p + 2\\beta \\dot{z}_p + \\omega_0^2 z_p = f_0 e^{i \\omega t}$$\n$$\\left(-\\omega^2 + 2\\beta i \\omega + \\omega_0^2\\right) C e^{i \\omega t} = f_0 e^{i \\omega t}$$\n\nWe can cancel the $e^{i \\omega t}$ terms on both sides of the equation, and we are left with\n\n$$\\left(-\\omega^2 + 2\\beta i \\omega + \\omega_0^2\\right) C = f_0.$$\n\nWe can solve for $C$:\n\n$$C = \\dfrac{f_0}{\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 + 2\\beta i \\omega}.$$\n\nWe found $C$ and it is fully determined. But it is a complex number. Ultimately, we want a real valued solution, but we remember that \n\n$$Re(z(t)) = x(t) \\qquad Im(z(t)) = y(t).$$\n\nAnd we can write the coefficient $C$ as a magnitude $A$ and a phase $\\delta$:\n\n$$C = A e^{-i \\delta}$$\n\n### Writing the Complex Amplitude\n\nLet's find that form of $C$.\n\n$$A^2 = CC^*$$\n$$A^2 = \\left(\\dfrac{f_0}{\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 + 2\\beta i \\omega}\\right) \\left(\\dfrac{f_0}{\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 - 2\\beta i \\omega}\\right)$$\n$$A^2 = \\dfrac{f_0^2}{\\left(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2\\right)^2 + 4\\beta^2 \\omega^2}$$\n\nSo the amplitude of the particular solution is\n\n$$A = \\dfrac{f_0}{\\sqrt{\\left(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2\\right)^2 + 4\\beta^2 \\omega^2}}.$$\n\nWe can find the phase by looking at $C= A e^{-i \\delta}$:\n\n$$C = \\dfrac{f_0}{\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 + 2\\beta i \\omega} = A e^{-i \\delta}$$\n\n$$f_0e^{i\\delta} = A \\left(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 + 2\\beta i \\omega\\right)$$\n\nNote that both $f_0$ and $A$ are real numbers, so the complex phase of $\\delta$ is determined by the complex number on the right side of the equation.\n\nThat is, the phase of the $e^{-i\\delta}$ term and the phase of the complex number $\\left(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 + 2\\beta i \\omega\\right)$ are the same. So we can write ratio of their imaginary and real parts as,\n\n$$\\tan(\\delta) = \\dfrac{2\\beta \\omega}{\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2}$$\n\n$$\\delta = \\arctan\\left(\\dfrac{2\\beta \\omega}{\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2}\\right)$$\n\nAgain, this number is fully determined without initial conditions.\n\n### Back to the Particular Solution\n\nWe proposed a solution $z_p(t) = C e^{i \\omega t}$, where $C$ is a complex constant. This became\n\n$$z_p(t) = A e^{-i \\delta} e^{i \\omega t} = A e^{i(\\omega t - \\delta)}$$\n\nwhere $A$ is a real number and $\\delta$ is a real number. Note we can write the particular solutions for both $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ as\n\n$$x_p(t) = Re\\left(z_p(t)\\right) = A \\cos(\\omega t - \\delta)$$\n$$y_p(t) = Im\\left(z_p(t)\\right) = A \\sin(\\omega t - \\delta)$$\n\n### General Solution\n\nThe proposed general solution was \n\n$$x(t) = x_h(t) + x_p(t)$$\n\nAnd for our sinusoidal driving force, we have found the particular solution, so that we can write:\n\n$$x(t) = x_h(t) + A \\cos(\\omega t - \\delta)$$\n\nwhere $x_h(t)$ is the solution to the homogeneous equation, $\\mathcal{D} x_h(t) = 0$.\n\nWe propose a solution form for $x_h(t)$ that is a linear combination of two exponential functions (as we did before):\n\n$$x_h(t) = C_1 e^{\\lambda_1 t} + C_2 e^{\\lambda_2 t}.$$\n\nThese are solutions to the damped oscillator, and we refer to them as the \"transient\" solutions. They are transient because they die out over time due to damping. \n\nFor a weakly damped system, $\\beta^2 < \\omega_0^2$, which is the case that is most interesting to us, we can write the solution as,\n\n$$x(t) = A \\cos(\\omega t - \\delta) + A_{tr}e^{-\\beta t} \\cos(\\omega_1 t - \\delta_{tr})$$\n\nwhere $A_{tr}$ is the amplitude of the transient solution, $\\omega_1 = \\sqrt{\\omega_0^2 - \\beta^2}$ is the damped frequency (per usual), and $\\delta_{tr}$ is the phase of the transient solution.\n\n\n## Resonance and Tuning\n\nA curious thing about the long term behavior (after the transients die out) is that we can observe large amplitudes at particular choices of driving. Consider the long term (stady state) solution to the driven damped harmonic oscillator:\n\n$$x_{longterm}(t) = A \\cos(\\omega t - \\delta)$$\n\nwhere,\n\n$$A^2 = \\dfrac{f_0^2}{\\left(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2\\right)^2 + 4\\beta^2 \\omega^2}.$$\n\nLet's allow $\\beta$ to be small so that $4\\beta^2 \\omega^2$ is small. If we focus on the denominator, we can see that the amplitude will be small when $\\omega$ is far from $\\omega_0$. But if we choose $\\omega$ to be close to $\\omega_0$, then the denominator will be small, and the amplitude will be large.\n\nThe second result is a [resonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance) effect. The system will resonate at a particular frequency, $\\omega_0$, and the amplitude of the oscillations will be large. Below is a sketch of the response of a driven damped harmonic oscillator to a sinusoidal driving force. The amplitude of the oscillations is plotted as a function of the driving frequency $\\omega$.\n\n![Resonance Sketch](../images/notes/week9/resonance.png)\n\n### Achieving Resonance\n\nThere's two ways that we can approach this. Let's focus on the denominator of the amplitude equation:\n\n$$\\left(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2\\right)^2 + 4\\beta^2 \\omega^2$$\n\nWhen that denominator is small, the amplitude will be large. There's two ways to make the denominator small.\n\n**Case 1:** Tune the $\\omega_0$ (the natural frequency of the system) to be close to $\\omega$ (the driving frequency). This is how a car radio works. You change the resistance of the radio circuit to change the natural frequency of the radio circuit. You can then tune the radio to a particular station that is broadcasting at a particular frequency. This gives an amplified signal,\n\nWhen $\\omega_0 = \\omega$, then the denominator is equal to $4\\beta^2 \\omega_0^2$. The amplitude is\n\n$$A = \\dfrac{f_0}{2\\beta \\omega_0}.$$\n\n**Case 2:** Tune the driver ($\\omega$) to be close to $\\omega_0$. \n\nBecause we are adjusting the driver, we are seeking the driving frequency that minizes the denominator. We can do this by setting the derivative of the denominator with respect to $\\omega$ to zero.\n\n$$\\dfrac{d}{d\\omega} \\left(\\left(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2\\right)^2 + 4\\beta^2 \\omega^2\\right) = 0$$\n\n$$2\\left(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2\\right) \\left(-2\\omega\\right) + 8\\beta^2 \\omega = 0$$\n\n$$-4\\omega_0^2 \\omega + 4\\omega^3 + 8\\beta^2 \\omega = 0$$\n\n$$4\\omega\\left(\\omega^2 - \\omega_0^2 + 2\\beta^2\\right) = 0$$\n\n$$\\omega = 0 \\qquad \\text{or} \\qquad \\omega^2 - \\omega_0^2 + 2\\beta^2 = 0$$\n\nThie first solution is when there is no driver. But the second, $\\omega_2$, is the frequency that minimizes the denominator. We can write that as\n\n$$\\omega_2 = \\sqrt{\\omega_0^2 - 2\\beta^2}$$\n\nWe can a strong response when $\\omega_0^2 \\gg 2\\beta^2$ or when $\\omega_2 \\approx \\omega_0$.\n\n\n```python\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n"

        "# Week 10 - Chaotic Dynamics\n\n[Chaos theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory) is a branch of science that focuses on the study of systems that exhibit chaotic behavior. These systems are quite sensitive to their initial conditions, meaning that small changes or even errors in measurements can lead to vastly different outcomes. These systems tend have strange couplings and feedback loops, making them very difficult to predict. These systems are nonlinear, meaning that the mathematical tools we bring to bear are often more sophisticated. And, computing is often required to simulate and understand the behavior of these systems.\n\nWe will focus on classical chaos, where the systems are [deterministic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_system); they follow specific laws or equations. There is no inherent randomness included in the system. In some cases, folks include [noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_(electronics)) in their system, but this is not required for a system to be chaotic. Even though they are fully deterministic, due to their sensitivity to initial conditions, classical chaotic systems can appear random and unpredictable over time. \n\n## Characteristics of Chaotic Systems\n\nChaotic systems exhibit several key characteristics that distinguish them from other types of [dynamical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system)\n\n### Sensitive Dependence on Initial Conditions\n\nOne of the hallmark features of chaotic systems is their sensitive dependence on initial conditions. Even tiny differences in the starting state of the system can lead to dramatically different outcomes. While in many cases this means that we cannot predict the long-term behavior of the system, in some cases we can still make accurate short-term predictions. This concept has been abstracted into the popular saying \"a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil can cause a tornado in Texas,\" illustrating how small changes can have far-reaching effects. But it is true that in weather systems, small changes in atmospheric conditions can result in significantly different weather patterns.\n\n### Nonlinearity\n\nChaotic systems are typically [nonlinear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_system); simple linear equations and the properties of their solutions are not sufficient to describe their behavior. The couplings of different aspects of the system can lead to feedback loops and interactions that are not simply additive. The mathematical equations governing chaotic systems often involve nonlinear functions, and are thus require different tools to analyze. Moreover, these nonlinear behaviors can change dramatically with small changes in the system parameters. These can lead to [bifurcations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifurcation) in the system, where a small change in a parameter can cause a sudden and qualitative change in the system's behavior. This is just another reason why chaotic systems are so difficult to predict and control\n\n### Strange Attractors\n\nWe have seen how systems can have fixed points - both stable and unstable - and we have seen periodic behavior. These are common in many dynamical systems. In our study of the harmonic oscillator, we observed that the system can exhibit periodic behavior when undamped or driven, but we also saw how it can settle to a stable fixed point when damped. As we move to study chaotic systems, we begin to see other kinds of behavior. Systems can have [limit cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_cycle) - periodic orbits that are stable or unstable. Below we show the limit cycle of the [Van der Pol oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Pol_oscillator), \n\n![Limit Cycle](../images/notes/week10/640px-VanDerPolPhaseSpace.png))\n\n\nOne of the most interesting types of [attractors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor) in dynamical systems is the [strange attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_attractor). These are fractal structures in phase space towards which the system evolves over time. Strange attractors are complex and often exhibit self-similarity, meaning they look similar at different scales. The [Lorenz attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system) is a famous example of a strange attractor, displaying a butterfly-shaped pattern.\n\n<!-- ![Lorenz Attractor](../images/notes/week10/A_Trajectory_Through_Phase_Space_in_a_Lorenz_Attractor.gif) -->\n\n### Long-term Unpredictability\n\nWhile chaotic systems can be predictable in the short term, their long-term behavior is inherently unpredictable due to the exponential growth of errors in initial conditions. You can think about this in terms of taking a bundle of trajectories that all start with slightly different initial conditions. As time goes on, these trajectories will diverge from one another; they will do so exponentially in every direction. The direction in which they diverge most rapidly is called the [Lyapunov exponent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyapunov_exponent). Technically, there's an exponent for each direction in phase space, but we often just refer to the largest one. If the largest Lyapunov exponent is positive, then the system is chaotic. \n\n\n\n"

        "# Week 10 - Activity: Modeling Chaotic Systems\n\nChaotic systems are complex and unpredictable, often exhibiting sensitive dependence on initial conditions. This can make numerically simulating them challenging. We have used a variety of integrators and noticed that some are better than others for different problems. Here, we will use the built-in integrator from the `scipy` library to simulate our systems ([`solve_ivp`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.html)).\n\nThis integrator is designed to be robust and efficient, making it a good choice for a wide range of problems. We can also specify the integrator to use, which can be helpful for specific applications. In our case, we will use the default integrator, which is a good general-purpose integrator. However, we can also specify other integrators, such as `RK45`, `RK23`, `DOP853`, etc., depending on our needs. For the most part, these integrators are using different methods of estimating the slope of the function at each step, which can affect the accuracy and stability of the simulation. They also have different efficiency and performance characteristics, which can be important for large-scale simulations.\n\nWe start with a code that simulates a damped driven pendulum, and the plots we want to obtain. You will can use those to develop simulations of the [Duffing oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duffing_equation) and the [Lorenz system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system) later.\n\n## Using solve_ivp to simulate chaotic systems\n\nWe have written a variety of integrators for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs). In this activity, we will introduce the `solve_ivp` function from the `scipy.integrate` module, which is a versatile and powerful tool for solving ODEs. We will use it to simulate chaotic systems and explore its capabilities.\n\nTo set up a `solve_ivp` simulation, we need to define the system of ODEs we want to solve. Let's focus on the damped driven pendulum, a classic example that we will use to illustrate the process. \n\n### Damped Driving Pendulum\n\nConsider a pendulum that can swing in a plane on a pivot. The pendulum hinge is driven by a horizontal oscillator that oscillates with a constant frequency and amplitude. The second order ODE that describes such a damped driven pendulum is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + \\beta \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\sin(\\theta) = A \\cos(\\omega_D t)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\theta$ is the angle of the pendulum, $\\beta$ is the damping coefficient, $A$ is the amplitude of the driving force, and $\\omega_D$ is the angular frequency of the driving force. We've absorbed some constants into the parameters for simplicity.\n\n### Using solve_ivp\n\nTo use `solve_ivp`, we need to convert this second-order ODE into a system of first-order ODEs. We can do this by introducing a new variable for the angular velocity:\n\n$$\\dot{\\theta} = \\omega$$\n$$\\dot{\\omega} = -\\sin(\\theta) - \\beta \\omega + A \\cos(\\omega_D t)$$\n\n\nwhere $\\omega$ is the angular velocity of the pendulum NOT the driver.\n\nLet's implement this system using `solve_ivp` and simulate its behavior over time.\n\n**Read over this code and run it.** Make sure you make sense of what each part does. You will need to modify it for the next part of the activity.\n\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib import gridspec\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\nplt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8-colorblind')\n\n# Define the damped driven pendulum equations\n# Note that they are first order ODEs\ndef damped_driven_pendulum(t, y, beta, A, omegaD=1):\n    theta, omega = y\n    dtheta_dt = omega\n    domega_dt = -np.sin(theta) - beta * omega + A * np.cos(omegaD*t)\n    return [dtheta_dt, domega_dt]\n\n# Parameters that define the system\nbeta = 0.5         # Damping coefficient\nA = 1.0             # Amplitude of driving force\nomegaD = 2*np.pi  # Driving frequency\nt_span = (0, 100)   # Time span for the simulation\ny0 = [6, 0]     # Initial conditions: theta = pi, omega = 0; Note that solve_ivp takes a list of initial conditions\nt_eval = np.linspace(t_span[0], t_span[1], 10000)  # Time points to evaluate; Note that solve_ivp takes a list of times to evaluate\n\n# Solve the ODEs using solve_ivp\n# Here we pass the function, time span, initial conditions, parameters, and time points to evaluate\n# Any additional arguments to the function can be passed in args in the form of a tuple\n# Note that the order of arguments in args must match the order of parameters in the function\nsolution = solve_ivp(damped_driven_pendulum, t_span, y0, args=(beta, A, omegaD), t_eval=t_eval)\n```\n\n### Plotting the resulting solution\n\nThe solution from `solve_ivp` gives us the values of $\\theta$ and $\\omega$ over time. We can use this data to create plots that help us visualize the behavior of the damped driven pendulum. These results are evaluated at discrete time points, so we can use them to create time series plots or phase space plots.\n\nThe solution object returned by `solve_ivp` contains several attributes, including `t` (the time points) and `y` (the values of the variables at each time point). We can use these to create our plots. Note that the first column of `y` corresponds to $\\theta$ and the second column corresponds to $\\omega$ because we defined them in that order in the `damped_driven_pendulum` function above.\n\n\n```python\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(16, 4))\ngs = gridspec.GridSpec(2, 2, figure=fig, height_ratios=[1, 1], width_ratios=[3, 1])\n\n\nax0 = fig.add_subplot(gs[0, 0])\nax0.plot(solution.t, solution.y[0])\nplt.scatter(solution.t[0], solution.y[0][0], color='C1', marker='o', label='Start', s=50)\nplt.scatter(solution.t[-1], solution.y[0][-1], color='C2', marker='s', label='End', s=50)\nax0.set_title('Time Series')\nax0.set_ylabel('Position')\nax0.legend()\nax0.grid()\n\nax1 = fig.add_subplot(gs[1,0])\nax1.plot(solution.t, solution.y[1])\nplt.scatter(solution.t[0], solution.y[1][0], color='C1', marker='o', label='Start', s=50)\nplt.scatter(solution.t[-1], solution.y[1][-1], color='C2', marker='s', label='End', s=50)\nax1.set_xlabel('Time')\nax1.set_ylabel('Velocity')\nax1.legend()\nax1.grid()\n\nax2 = fig.add_subplot(gs[:, 1])\nax2.plot(solution.y[0], solution.y[1])\nax2.set_title('Phase Space')\nplt.scatter(solution.y[0][0], solution.y[1][0], color='C1', marker='o', label='Start', s=50)\nplt.scatter(solution.y[0][-1], solution.y[1][-1], color='C2', marker='s', label='End', s=50)\nax2.set_xlabel('Position')\nax2.set_ylabel('Velocity')\nax2.legend()\nax2.grid()\nplt.tight_layout()\n```\n\n\n    \n![png](10_notes_files/10_notes_4_0.png)\n    \n\n\nWhat do you notice about the behavior of this system? Both short and long term? How can you see that in your plots?\n\n**Your Answer Here**\n\n### Investigating Periodicity\n\nAs you recall, the damped driven oscillator has two solutions - a transient solution that decays to zero, and a steady-state solution that is periodic. You can see in the above plot that the system starts with a transient solution, but eventually settles into a periodic solution.  Let's truncate the time to see the periodic solution more clearly. Let's look at the last 40 seconds of the simulation. We used `t_eval` to only evaluate the solution at 1000 points, between 0 and 100. We don't need to recalculate the solution, we can just plot the last 40 seconds of the solution we already calculated.\n\nTo check the periodicity, we investigate if the time series returns to the same value after a certain period. We can do this by plotting the time series after the transients have decayed. If the system is periodic, we should see a repeating pattern in the plot. Using the physics of the driver, we can plot a point at every period of the driver to see if the system returns to the same value, $T = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}$.\n\nWe do that below to demonstrate that after the transient solution decays, the system settles into a single periodic solution. \n\nOne route to chaos is [period-doubling bifurcation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period-doubling_bifurcation), where the system goes from a single period to two periods. You can see that we are not at that point yet, but the [Duffing oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duffing_equation) is a classic example of a system that exhibits period-doubling bifurcation. \n\n\n```python\n# Note this block runs the integration again but only returns the last 60 seconds of the simulation\nstartTime = 60\nindex = np.where(solution.t > startTime)[0][0]\n\nsolution_short_time = solution.t[index:]\nsolution_short_theta = solution.y[0][index:]\nsolution_short_omega = solution.y[1][index:]\n\n# Indicies where solution repeats every 2pi/omegaD\nperiod = 2*np.pi/omegaD\nindices = np.where((solution_short_time % period) < 0.01)[0]\n\n\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(16, 4))\ngs = gridspec.GridSpec(2, 2, figure=fig, height_ratios=[1, 1], width_ratios=[3, 1])\n\n\nax0 = fig.add_subplot(gs[0, 0])\nax0.plot(solution_short_time, solution_short_theta)\nax0.scatter(solution_short_time[0], solution_short_theta[0], color='C1', marker='o', label='Start', s=50)\nax0.scatter(solution_short_time[-1], solution_short_theta[-1], color='C2', marker='s', label='End', s=50)\nax0.scatter(solution_short_time[indices], solution_short_theta[indices], color='C3', marker='x', s=50)\nax0.set_title('Time Series')\nax0.set_ylabel('Position')\nax0.legend()\nax0.grid()\n\nax1 = fig.add_subplot(gs[1,0])\nax1.plot(solution_short_time, solution_short_omega)\nax1.scatter(solution_short_time[0], solution_short_omega[0], color='C1', marker='o', label='Start', s=50)\nax1.scatter(solution_short_time[-1], solution_short_omega[-1], color='C2', marker='s', label='End', s=50)\nax1.scatter(solution_short_time[indices], solution_short_omega[indices], color='C3', marker='x', s=50)\nax1.set_xlabel('Time')\nax1.set_ylabel('Velocity')\nax1.legend()\nax1.grid()\n\nax2 = fig.add_subplot(gs[:, 1])\nax2.plot(solution_short_theta, solution_short_omega)\nax2.set_title('Phase Space')\nax2.scatter(solution_short_theta[0], solution_short_omega[0], color='C1', marker='o', label='Start', s=50)\nax2.scatter(solution_short_theta[-1], solution_short_omega[-1], color='C2', marker='s', label='End', s=50)\nax2.scatter(solution_short_theta[indices], solution_short_omega[indices], color='C3', marker='x', s=50)\nax2.set_xlabel('Position')\nax2.set_ylabel('Velocity')\nax2.legend()\nax2.grid()\nplt.tight_layout()\n```\n\n\n    \n![png](10_notes_files/10_notes_7_0.png)\n    \n\n\nHow does this view of the long term solution help us see the periodicity of the motion? How could we check if the motion follows the driving frequency?\n\n**Your Answer Here**\n\n### A Period-1 Solution\n\nWhile the specific location of the marked points might vary a little but, we can see that there's roughly a repeated location of those points. In the case of position or velocity, the pink ex marks the spot where the system returns to the same value. The phase space makes that more clear because we can see that the system returns to the roughly the same point in phase space. This is close to a period-1 solution. It might be that we still have some transient behavior, or that our integrator is not perfectly accurate, or that our scheme for selecting the time points is not perfect, but we can see that the system is close to periodic.\n\nWe can use this approach to investigate other chaotic systems and explore their behavior over time.\n\n## Period Doubling with the Duffing Oscillator\n\nThe Duffing oscillator is a non-linear second-order differential equation that describes the motion of a damped and driven oscillator with a non-linear restoring force. Under certain conditions, it can exhibit chaotic behavior, including period-doubling bifurcations. There are many routes to chaos, but period-doubling is a classic example.\n\nThe model is given by:\n\n$$\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + \\delta \\frac{dx}{dt} + \\alpha x + \\beta x^3 = \\gamma \\cos(\\omega t)$$\n\nWe can rewrite this as a system of first-order ODEs by introducing a new variable for the velocity:\n\n$$\\dot{x} = v$$\n$$\\dot{v} = -\\delta v - \\alpha x - \\beta x^3 + \\gamma \\cos(\\omega t).$$\n\n### Numerically Integrate the Duffing Oscillator\n\nFor our simulation we will observe the effect of the driving strength $\\gamma$ on the behavior of the system. We start with the following parameters:\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --------- | ----- |\n| $\\delta$  | 0.2   |\n| $\\alpha$  | -1    |\n| $\\beta$   | 1     |\n| $\\gamma$  | 0.3   |\n| $\\omega$  | 1.2     |\n\nChoose the initial conditions and time span for the simulation:\n| Condition | Value |\n| --------- | ----- |\n| Initial $x$ | 1.0   |\n| Initial $v$ | 0     |\n| Time span | 100 cycles of the driver |\n| Evaluation points | 10000 |\n\nBelow we've provided some of the code, but not the definition of the `duffing` function. You will need to write that function and fill in the missing code to complete the simulation.\n\n**Write the rest of the code necessary to simulate the Duffing oscillator.**\n\n**Plot the results of your simulation in the next cell.**\n\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib import gridspec\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\nplt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8-colorblind')\n```\n\n\n```python\n## def duffing(t, y, delta, alpha, beta, gamma, omega):\n    ## Your Code Here\n\n# Parameters\ndelta = 0.3\nalpha = -1.0\nbeta = 1.0\ngamma = 0.2\nomega = 1.2\n\n# Time span and initial conditions\ncycles = 100\ntfinal = 2 * np.pi * cycles / omega\nt_span = (0, tfinal)\nt_eval = np.linspace(t_span[0], t_span[1], 10000)\ny0 = [1.0, 0.0]\n\n# Solve the ODEs using solve_ivp\n## Your Code Here\n```\n\n### Plotting the results\n\nOnce you have simulated the Duffing oscillator, you can plot the results to visualize its behavior over time. Your plot should be similar to the one above where you plot at least the position $x$ over time, and then a phase space plot of $x$ vs. $v$. Make sure that you label your axes and include a title for your plot; add starting and ending points to your plot so you are sure about the direction of the motion.\n\nThis first set of plots should look similar to the one below.\n\n![Duffing](../images/notes/week10/first_duffing.png)\n\n\n```python\n## Plot the time series and phase space\n## Your Code Here\n```\n\n### Investigating Periodicity\n\nNow that you have this solution, look at only the last few cycles of the simulation. You can do this by plotting only the last 10 cycles of the simulation. Include a mark at every cycle of the driver, $T = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}$. This will help you see if the system is periodic or not.\n\n\n```python\n## Plot the time series and phase space\n## Your Code Here\n```\n\nWhat did you find the periodicity of this particular set up to be? How did you determine it?\n\n**Your Answer Here**\n\n### Period Doubling\n\nLet's use the same code, or write this code in a new cell, or write a new function, to investigate the effect of increasing the driving strength $\\gamma$ on the behavior of the system. \n\nYou will **run the code multiple times**, changing the value of $\\gamma$ each time. You can do this by changing the value in the code, or by writing a loop to run through a range of values. In either case, you will need to plot the long term behavior of the system for each value of $\\gamma$, including the phase space plot. Your plot should also include a mark at every cycle of the driver, $T = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}$.\n\n\nFor choices of $\\gamma$, please use the following values: 0.2, 0.28, 0.29, 0.37, 0.50, 0.68, 0.74, 0.75, \n\n\n```python\n## Your Code Here\n```\n\n## Sensitivity to Initial Conditions with the Lorenz Attractor\n\nThe Lorenz attractor is a system of ordinary differential equations that model atmospheric convection. It is a classic example of a chaotic system that exhibits sensitive dependence on initial conditions. It also demonstrates the phenomenon of a [strange attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_attractor). A strange attractor is a fractal structure in phase space that the system approaches asymptotically over time. For the Lorenz attractor, the strange attractor is a set of points in phase space that the system approaches as time goes to infinity - the butterfly shape that you might be familiar with. \n\nIn this activity, we will simulate the Lorenz attractor using `solve_ivp` and explore how solutions diverge from each other based on small differences in initial conditions.\n\n### Mathematical Model\n\nThe Lorenz model is given by:\n\n$$\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\sigma (y - x)$$\n$$\\frac{dy}{dt} = x(\\rho - z) - y$$\n$$\\frac{dz}{dt} = xy - \\beta z$$\n\nWhere $\\sigma$, $\\rho$, and $\\beta$ are system parameters. The canonical values are $\\sigma = 10$, $\\rho = 28$, and $\\beta = \\frac{8}{3}$.\n\n### Numerically Integrate the Lorenz Attractor\n\nIn the cells below, we scaffold some of the code to simulate the Lorenz attractor. You will need to fill in the missing pieces. Once you plot the solution, you should be able to produce time series, and phase space plots of the Lorenz attractor. **Note that the phase space for the Lorenz attractor is 3D (x,y,z), so you will need to use a 3D plotting function or plot projections.**\n\nFor the parameters, we will use the canonical values of $\\sigma = 10$, $\\rho = 28$, and $\\beta = \\frac{8}{3}$. Choose initial conditions of $x=1$, $y=1$, and $z=1$ and simulate for 50 time units. If you do, your solution will look like the one below.\n\n![Lorenz Time Series](../images/notes/week10/lorenz-1.png)\n\n![Lorenz Phase Space](../images/notes/week10/lorenz-2.png)\n\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib import gridspec\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\nplt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8-colorblind')\n```\n\n\n```python\n## def lorenz(t, y, sigma, beta, rho):\n    ## Your Code Here\n\n# Parameters for the Lorenz system\nsigma = 10.0\nbeta = 8/3\nrho = 28.0\n\n# Time span and initial conditions\nt_span = (0, 50)\nt_eval = np.linspace(t_span[0], t_span[1], 10000)\ny0 = [1.0, 1.0, 1.0]\n\n# Solve the differential equations using solve_ivp\n## Your Code Here\n\n# Plotting your results\n## Your Code Here\n```\n\n### Exploring Sensitivity to Initial Conditions\n\nNoe that you have a solution to the Lorenz attractor, you can observe how trajectories that start from slightly different initial conditions diverge over time. This is a hallmark of chaotic systems, where small differences in initial conditions can lead to vastly different outcomes. We can visualize this as a bundle of trajectories that start from nearby points in phase space and then diverge over time. For the Lorenz attractor, this is often visualized as a butterfly-shaped structure in phase space.\n\nFor this activity, we will simulate the Lorenz attractor for two sets of initial conditions that are close together. We will then plot the trajectories in phase space to observe how they diverge over time.\n\n**Modify the code you wrote above to simulate the Lorenz attractor for two sets of initial conditions that are close together. Plot the trajectories in phase space to observe how they diverge over time. Do this as both a time series and in phase space.**\n\n\n```python\n## Your Code Here\n```\n\n### The Strange Attractor\n\nThe two trajectories that you plotted above should look like they are diverging over time. This is very common in chaotic systems. However, when you plot the trajectories in the phase space, they seem to occupy a bounded region of space - this is especially true as the trajectories evolve.\n\nThis bounded region is called a strange attractor. A strange attractor is a set of points in phase space that the system approaches asymptotically over time. For the Lorenz attractor, the strange attractor is a fractal structure that the system approaches as time goes to infinity.\n\nLet's plot a ton of trajectories starting from different initial conditions to see the strange attractor. We can do this by looping over a range of initial conditions and plotting each trajectory in phase space. \n\nThat will get very messy, so instead, let's integrate 100-1000 trajectories that are near the original trajectory. We will plot only the original and final location of each trajectory. This will give us a sense of the strange attractor without plotting every single trajectory.\n\n\n```python\n## Your Code Here\n```\n"

        "# Week 11 - Calculus of Variations\n\nWe are eventually going to develop some deep principles of classical mechanics that will connect for us the motion of particles and the forces they experience to the energy that moves between aspects of the system. This formulation of mechanics is called [Lagrangian Mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics). It is a powerful and elegant way to describe the motion of particles and systems. It is based on the [Calculus of Variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations), a field of mathematics that is concerned with finding the path that minimizes or maximizes (called \"extremization\") a certain quantity.\n\nThe conceptual idea of Lagrangian mechanics is to describe the motion of a system by defining a function called the **Lagrangian**. Under this framework, the stationary points (or paths) of the [action integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_(physics)), which is the integral of the Lagrangian over time, correspond to the actual motion of the system. This means that if you can find the path that minimizes or maximizes this action, you can determine the equations of motion for the system. We will come back to this next week when we derive the Lagrangian equations of motion. But understand that we are seeking to extremize a particular integral to find the path that a system will take through configuration space. \n\nOur examples will start with simple systems, like the motion on a plane - where we will prove a line is the shortest path between two points (also known as a geodesic). We will also recover a form of [Snell's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snell%27s_law) of refraction, which describes how light bends when it passes through different media. We will use running from the shoreline to a point in the water as an example of how to apply these principles. Lastly, we will look at the [Brachistochrone problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachistochrone_problem), which is the problem of finding the curve down which a bead will slide (without friction) from one point to another in the shortest time. This is a classic problem in the calculus of variations and leads us to the cycloid curve.\n\nThis section is mathematically intensive and will require you to have a solid understanding of calculus, including differentiation and integration. This mathematics is also very powerful and underlies how we can develop equations of motion in particular systems. But is also describes the shape of surfaces like bubbles and droplets. The video below is a nice introduction to the concept of Calculus of Variations and it's relation to [minimal surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_surface).\n\n## The Brachistochrone Problem (16 minute video)\n\nThe Brachistochrone is a well known problem and its history is quite interesting. The video below discusses the problem and it history in detail. It's what helped spur the development of the calculus of variations and the work of Lagrange and others. The problem is deceptively simple: given two points in a vertical plane, find the curve down which a bead will slide (without friction) from one point to the other in the shortest time. The solution to this problem is not a straight line, but rather a cycloid curve.\n\n[![Youtube Video on the Brachistochrone Problem](../images/notes/week11/Cld0p3a43fU.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cld0p3a43fU)\n\nSource: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cld0p3a43fU>\n\n## The Math of Bubbles (17 minute video)\n\nIn the video below, we learn about the [Soap Bubble Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap_bubble), which is another classic problem in the calculus of variations. The goal is to find the shape of a soap bubble that minimizes surface area for a given volume.\n\n[![The Math of Bubbles: Minimal Surfaces & the Calculus of Variations](../images/notes/week11/8SABptOYUVk.jpg)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=8SABptOYUVk))\n\nSource: <https://youtube.com/watch?v=8SABptOYUVk>\n\n\n"

        "# Week 11 - Notes: The Euler-Lagrange Equation\n\nAs we will use it, the [Calculus of Variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations) foucses on finding the conditions of extrema for quantities that can be expressed as an integral. This might be a very abstract concept, so we will start with a simple example.\n\nThis approach might seem a bit alien at first, but it turns out to be an interesting way to develop an equivalent formulation of mechanics. Moreover, the Calculus of Variations is a powerful tool in many fields, and forms the basis for [Lagrangian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics).\n\nTo do this, we will derive (in 1D) the [Euler-Lagrange equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Lagrange_equation). This equation gives us a way to find the function that makes the integral of a given functional stationary (i.e., a local maximum or minimum).\n\n\n## Canonical Conceptualization - Finding the Shortest Path in a Plane\n\nUsing the Calculus of Variations, we can show that the shortest path between two points in a plane is a straight line. This is a classic example, but it illustrates the concept well. Consider a general path in two-dimensional space that connects two points, say $s_1 = \\langle x_1, y_1 \\rangle$ and $s_2 = \\langle x_2, y_2 \\rangle$. We can represent this path as a function $y(x)$. The figure below illustrates the setup.\n\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8-colorblind')\n\nx1, x2 = 1, 5 \nxvals = np.linspace(x1, x2, 100)\n\nygeneric = np.sin((xvals - x1) / (x2 - x1) * np.pi/3) * (3) / 10 + (0 + 3) / 2 + 2*xvals**2\ny1, y2 = ygeneric[0], ygeneric[-1]  \n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\nax.plot(xvals, ygeneric, label=r'Generic Path, $y(x)$', color='C0')\nax.plot([x1, x2], [y1, y2], label='Shortest Path', color='C1', linestyle='--')\nax.plot(x1, y1, 'C2o')  # Point 1\nax.plot(x2, y2, 'C2o')  # Point 2\n\n# blank ticks\nax.set_xticks([])  # Remove x ticks\nax.set_yticks([])  # Remove y ticks\n\n# Set labels and title\nax.set_xlabel('x')\nax.set_ylabel('y')\nax.set_title('Shortest Path Between Two Points in a Plane')\n# Add a legend to the plot\nax.legend()\n# Show the plot\nplt.grid(True)  # Add grid for better readability\nplt.show()  # Display the plot\n```\n\n\n    \n![png](11_notes_files/11_notes_2_0.png)\n    \n\n\nThe blue solid line is the 'generic path' that connects the two points $s_1$ and $s_2$. The green dotted line is the solution that we expect to get when we ask, \"what is the shortest path between these two points?\" \n\n### Setup of the Problem\n\nLet's take a generic segment of the path $ds$ and express it in terms of its differential elements:\n\n$$ds = \\sqrt{dx^2 + dy^2}.$$\n\nThe length of the path from $s_1$ to $s_2$ can be expressed as an integral:\n\n$$l = \\int_{s_1}^{s_2} ds$$\n\nWe want to minimize this length, $l$, which is the total length of the path. To do this, we are attempting to minimize the integral of $ds$ over the path. This is where the Calculus of Variations comes in.\n\nLet's write the expression for $ds$ in a more convenient form. We can factor out the $dx$ term:\n\n$$ds = \\sqrt{dx^2 + dy^2} = dx \\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^2} = dx = \\sqrt{1 + y'(x)^2}$$\n\nwhere $y'(x) = \\frac{dy}{dx}$ is the derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$. So the integral for the length of the path becomes:\n\n$$l = \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} dx \\sqrt{1 + y'(x)^2}.$$\n\nThe function $y(x)$ defines the path that minimizes the length $l$. To find this path, we assume an incorrect function $Y(x)$ that is close to the true path $y(x)$, and we can express the difference between them as $\\alpha\\eta(x)$:\n\n$$Y(x) = \\underbrace{y(x)}_{\\textrm{correct}}+ \\underbrace{\\alpha\\eta(x)}_{\\textrm{minimize}}$$\n\nNote that $Y(x_1) = y(x_1)$ and $Y(x_2) = y(x_2)$, so the endpoints of the path are fixed. The function $\\eta(x)$ represents a small perturbation to the path, and $\\alpha$ is a small parameter that we will use to control the size of the perturbation.\n\n\n\n### Deriving the Euler-Lagrange Equation\n\nThe mathematical derivation involves extremizing the integral using a perturbation approach. The generic integral we are trying to minimize is for a function of the form:\n\n$$f(y(x),y'(x),x)),$$\n\nwhere $f$ is a function of $y$, its derivative $y'$, and the independent variable $x$. So that the integral we are minimizing can be expressed as:\n\n$$S=\\int_{x_1}^{x_2} f(y(x),y'(x),x) dx.$$\n\nWe assume $y(x)$ minimizes the integral $S$. So that any function $Y(x) = y(x) + \\alpha\\eta(x)$ produces a larger value for $S$,\n\n$$\\int_{s_1}^{s_2} f(Y(x),Y'(x),x) dx > \\int_{s_1}^{s_2} f(y(x),y'(x),x) dx.$$\n\nBecause we are looking for a minimum, we notice that when $\\alpha = 0$, we have $Y(x) = y(x)$, and the integral is at its minimum. To find the extremum, we can take the derivative of the integral with respect to $\\alpha$ and set it to zero:\n\n$$\\dfrac{dS}{d\\alpha}|_{\\alpha=0} = 0.$$\n\nWe start that analysis by differentiating the integral with respect to $\\alpha$:\n\n$$S = \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} f(Y(x),Y'(x),x) dx$$\n$$S = \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} f(y(x) + \\alpha\\eta(x), y'(x) + \\alpha\\eta'(x), x) dx.$$\n\nWe can now differentiate.\n\n$$\\dfrac{dS}{d\\alpha} = \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} \\left[ \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial Y}\\dfrac{dY}{d\\alpha} + \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial Y'}\\dfrac{dY'}{d\\alpha} + \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\dfrac{dx}{d\\alpha} \\right] dx.$$\n$$\\dfrac{dS}{d\\alpha} = \\dfrac{dY'}{d\\alpha}+ \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\dfrac{dx}{d\\alpha} dx.$$\n\nLet's take each term in turn. The first term is:\n\n$$\\dfrac{df}{dY}\\dfrac{dY}{d\\alpha}.$$\n\nLet's focus on the second part of that term:\n\n$$\\dfrac{dY}{d\\alpha} = \\dfrac{d}{d\\alpha}\\left[y(x) + \\alpha\\eta(x)\\right] = \\eta(x).$$\n\nLet's look at the second term:\n\n$$\\dfrac{dY'}{d\\alpha}.$$\n\nAgain, let's focus on the second part of that term:\n\n$$\\dfrac{dY'}{d\\alpha} = \\dfrac{d}{d\\alpha}\\left[y'(x) + \\alpha\\eta'(x)\\right] = \\eta'(x).$$\n\nLastly, the third term:\n\n$$\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\dfrac{dx}{d\\alpha}=0.$$\n\nThis term is a bit different. The $dx$ term is independent of $\\alpha$, so we can treat it as a constant with respect to $\\alpha$. Therefore, this term will not contribute to the derivative with respect to $\\alpha$, and we can ignore it in our analysis.\n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\n$$\\dfrac{dS}{d\\alpha} = \\int_{x_1}^{x_2}\\left[ \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial Y}\\eta(x) + \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial Y'}\\eta'(x) \\right] dx.$$\n\nOur expression is still in terms of $Y(x)$, the incorrect function. We want to express it in terms of $y(x)$, the correct function. Let's look at the derivatives $\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial Y}$ and $\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial Y'}$. We can use the chain rule to express these derivatives in terms of $y(x)$:\n\n$$\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial Y} = \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\dfrac{\\partial y}{\\partial Y} = \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial y},$$\n$$\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial Y'} = \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial y'}\\dfrac{\\partial y'}{\\partial Y'} = \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial y'}.$$\n\n**Why?** Because $\\dfrac{\\partial y}{\\partial Y} = 1$ and $\\dfrac{\\partial y'}{\\partial Y'} = 1$ when we are differentiating with respect to the correct function $y(x)$. This means that we can express the derivatives in terms of the correct function $y(x)$.\n\n$$\\dfrac{dS}{d\\alpha} = \\int_{x_1}^{x_2}\\left[ \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\eta(x) + \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial y'}\\eta'(x) \\right] dx.$$\n\nWe are seeking $\\dfrac{dS}{d\\alpha}$ at $\\alpha = 0$, so we set the integral to zero:\n\n$$\\int_{x_1}^{x_2}\\left[ \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\eta(x) + \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial y'}\\eta'(x) \\right] dx = 0.$$\n\n#### Integration by Parts\n\nNow to deal with the integral here, we can use integration by parts:\n\n$$\\int u'v dx = [uv] - \\int u v' dx$$\n\nThe first term $[uv]$ is called the \"surface term\" because it is the result of the integral and is evaluated at the boundaries of the integral, $x_1$ and $x_2$. We will apply integration by parts only to the second term in the integral.\n\nHere, we note $u = \\eta(x)$ and $v = \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial y'}$. Then, we can express the second term in the integral as follows:\n\n$$\\int_{x_1}^{x_2} \\eta'(x) \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial y'} dx = \\underbrace{\\left[ \\eta(x) \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial y'} \\right]_{x_1}^{x_2}}_{\\eta(x_1)=\\eta(x_2)=0} - \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} \\eta(x) \\dfrac{d}{dx}\\left( \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial y'} \\right) dx$$\n$$\\int_{x_1}^{x_2} \\eta'(x) \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial y'} dx = - \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} \\eta(x) \\dfrac{d}{dx}\\left( \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial y'} \\right) dx$$\n\nNotice that the surface term evaluates to zero because we have fixed the endpoints of the path, so $\\eta(x_1) = \\eta(x_2) = 0$.  We put this all together to get:\n\n$$\\dfrac{dS}{d\\alpha} = \\int_{x_1}^{x_2}\\left[ \\eta(x)\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} - \\eta(x) \\dfrac{d}{dx}\\left( \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial y'} \\right) \\right] dx = 0.$$\n$$\\dfrac{dS}{d\\alpha} = \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} \\eta(x) \\left[ \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} - \\dfrac{d}{dx}\\left( \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial y'} \\right) \\right] dx = 0.$$\n\n```{important}\nThe last statement is true for any arbitrary function $\\eta(x)$, so we can conclude that the term in square brackets must be zero:\n\n$$\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} - \\dfrac{d}{dx}\\left( \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial y'} \\right) = 0.$$\n\nThis is the **[Euler-Lagrange equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Lagrange_equation)** for a 1D problem.\n```\n\n### Back to the Shortest Path Example\n\nNow let's apply the Euler-Lagrange equation to our original problem of finding the shortest path between two points in a plane. We have:\n\n$$l = \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} \\sqrt{1 + y'(x)^2} dx.$$\n\nHere, we can identify our function $f$ as:\n\n$$f(y(x), y'(x), x) = \\sqrt{1 + y'(x)^2}.$$\n\nLet's apply the Euler-Lagrange equation to this function. \n\n$$\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} - \\dfrac{d}{dx}\\left( \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial y'} \\right) = 0.$$\n\nWe take the derivatives:\n\n$$\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 0$$\n\nsince $f$ does not depend on $y$, only on $y'$. Now let's compute the second term:\n\n$$\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial y'} = \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial y'}\\left( \\sqrt{1 + y'(x)^2} \\right)$$\n$$\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial y'} = \\dfrac{1}{2} \\left(1 + y'(x)^2\\right)^{-1/2} 2y'(x)$$\n$$\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial y'} = \\frac{y'(x)}{\\sqrt{1 + y'(x)^2}}.$$\n\nLet's put all this together:\n\n$$0 = \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} - \\dfrac{d}{dx}\\left( \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial y'} \\right)$$\n$$0 = 0 - \\dfrac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{y'(x)}{\\sqrt{1 + y'(x)^2}}\\right).$$\n\nThis means that,\n\n$$\\dfrac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{y'(x)}{\\sqrt{1 + y'(x)^2}}\\right) = 0$$\n\nThis implies that:\n\n$$\\frac{y'(x)}{\\sqrt{1 + y'(x)^2}} = C = \\textrm{a constant}.$$\n\nOr rearranging gives us:\n\n\n$$y'(x) = C\\sqrt{1 + y'(x)^2}$$\n$$y'(x)^2 = C^2(1 + y'(x)^2)$$\n$$(1 - C^2)y'(x)^2 = C^2$$\n$$y'(x)^2 = \\frac{C^2}{1 - C^2}$$\n$$y'(x) = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{C^2}{1 - C^2}}$$\n\n\nSo that, $y'(x)$ is a constant, call it $m$, which produces a linear solution.\n\n$$\\dfrac{dy}{dx} = \\sqrt{\\frac{C^2}{1 - C^2}} = m$$\n\nIntegrating gives us:\n\n$$y(x) = mx + b$$\n\nwhere $b$ is a constant of integration. This is the equation of a straight line!\n\n## Example: Snell's Law\n\nLet's assume you are walking on the beach and need to get to a location in the water quickly. Where do you enter the water to minimize the time it takes to reach the location in the water? This is a classic problem in physics and can be solved using the Calculus of Variations.\n\nConsider the picture below where you can move at a speed $v_1$ on the shore and a speed $v_2$ in the water. We know that $v_1 > v_2$, so you can move faster on the shore than in the water. We aim to minimize the time it takes to reach the point $\\langle x_2, y_2 \\rangle$ in the water from point $\\langle x_1, y_1 \\rangle$ on the shore. We take the shoreline to be a line at $x = 0$. and the location we cross the shoreline is $\\langle 0, y \\rangle$.\n\n![Snell's Law Diagram](../images/notes/week11/snells_shore.png)\n\nNotice the angle that we approach the shoreline at, $\\theta_1$, and the angle that we approach the target in the water, $\\theta_2$.\n\nThe total time to travel from $\\langle x_1, y_1 \\rangle$ to $\\langle 0, y \\rangle$ and then to $\\langle x_2, y_2 \\rangle$ is:\n\n$$T = t_1 + t_2 = \\dfrac{d_1}{v_1} + \\dfrac{d_2}{v_2}$$\n\nwhere $d_1$ is the distance from $\\langle x_1, y_1 \\rangle$ to $\\langle 0, y \\rangle$, and $d_2$ is the distance from $\\langle 0, y \\rangle$ to $\\langle x_2, y_2 \\rangle$. We can write those distances in terms of the coordinates:\n\n$$d_1 = \\sqrt{x_1^2 + (y - y_1)^2}$$\n$$d_2 = \\sqrt{x_2^2 + (y_2 - y)^2}$$\n\nThis gives us:\n\n$$T = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{x_1^2 + (y - y_1)^2}}{v_1} + \\dfrac{\\sqrt{x_2^2 + (y_2 - y)^2}}{v_2}.$$\n\nWe want to minimize this time, $T$, by choosing the optimal point $y$ where we cross the shoreline. We compute the derivative of $T$ with respect to $y$ and set it to zero:\n\n$$\\dfrac{dT}{dy} = 0$$\n\n\n$$\\dfrac{dT}{dy} = \\dfrac{1}{2}\\dfrac{1}{v_1}\\left(x_1^2 + (y-y_1)^2\\right)^{-1/2}(2)(y-y_1) + \\dfrac{1}{2}\\dfrac{1}{v_2}\\left(x_2^2 + (y_2-y)^2\\right)^{-1/2}(-2)(y_2-y) = 0$$\n$$\\dfrac{dT}{dy} = \\dfrac{1}{v_1}\\left(\\dfrac{y-y_1}{\\sqrt{x_1^2 + (y-y_1)^2}}\\right) - \\dfrac{1}{v_2}\\left(\\dfrac{y_2-y}{\\sqrt{x_2^2 + (y_2-y)^2}}\\right) = 0$$\n$$\\dfrac{dT}{dy} = \\dfrac{1}{v_1}\\left(\\dfrac{y-y_1}{d_1}\\right) - \\dfrac{1}{v_2}\\left(\\dfrac{y_2-y}{d_2}\\right) = 0$$\n\nwhere the last step is just substituting in the expressions for $d_1$ and $d_2$. Notice that those expressions are related to the angles we defined earlier. We can rewrite the expression in terms of the angles $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$:\n\n$$\\sin(\\theta_1) = \\frac{y - y_1}{d_1}$$\n$$\\sin(\\theta_2) = \\frac{y_2 - y}{d_2}$$\n\nThis gives us:\n\n$$\\dfrac{\\sin(\\theta_1)}{v_1} - \\dfrac{\\sin(\\theta_2)}{v_2} = 0$$\n\n```{important}\nThis is [**Snell's Law**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snell%27s_law)! It tells us that the ratio of the sine of the angles to the velocities is constant. This is a classic result in optics, but it also applies to this problem of finding the shortest path in a plane.\n\n$$\\dfrac{\\sin(\\theta_1)}{v_1} = \\dfrac{\\sin(\\theta_2)}{v_2}$$\n```\n\n## Example: Brachistochrone Problem\n\nThe [Brachistochrone problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachistochrone_problem) is a classic problem in the Calculus of Variations. It asks the question: \"What is the shape of the curve that a bead will follow under the influence of gravity to reach the bottom in the shortest time?\"  Here's a great video from [Steven Strogatz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Strogatz) that explains the problem and its solution.\n\n[![Youtube Video on the Brachistochrone Problem](../images/notes/week11/Cld0p3a43fU.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cld0p3a43fU)\n\nSource: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cld0p3a43fU>\n\nThe setup is below, there's two points separated by a distance vertically and horizontally. What shape should we make a track so that a bead will roll down it in the shortest time?\n\n![The Brachistochrone Problem](../images/notes/week11/brachistochrone.png)\n\nThe time it takes for the bead to roll down the curve is given by:\n\n$$T = \\int_{1}^{2} \\dfrac{ds}{v}$$\n\nwhere $ds$ is the differential arc length along the curve, and $v$ is the velocity of the bead at that point. The generic step is the same as before:\n\n$$ds = \\sqrt{dx^2 + dy^2}.$$\n\n#### Velocity of the Bead\n\nWhat about $v$? Because the bead is moving under the influence of gravity, we can use conservation of energy to find the velocity. Note that we don't model the rolling of the bead, just the motion down the track. We also neglect all frictional forces. This is a major simplification, but it will give us an analytical solution.\n\n$$\\Delta K + \\Delta U = 0$$\n\nIf the bead starts from rest, then $v_i = 0$, and we can write:\n\n$$\\dfrac{1}{2}mv^2 - \\dfrac{1}{2}m(0)^2 + mg(\\Delta y) = 0,$$\n\n$$v = \\sqrt{2g\\Delta y}$$\n\nwhere $\\Delta y = y_1 - y_2 > 0$. This is the change in height of the bead as it rolls down the track. We can express this in terms of the coordinates of the two points, $y_1$ and $y_2$.\n\nLet's move the origin to the top of the track and measure $+y$ downwards. Thus, for any point on the track, we have:\n\n$$v = \\sqrt{2gy}.$$\n\nWe can now write the integral again,\n\n$$T = \\int_{1}^{2} \\dfrac{ds}{v} = \\int_{1}^{2} \\dfrac{\\sqrt{dx^2 + dy^2}}{\\sqrt{2gy}}.$$\n\nWe notice that we can factor out a $dy$ term from the square root in the numerator:\n\n$$\\sqrt{dx^2 + dy^2} = dy\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{dx}{dy}\\right)^2 + 1} = dy \\sqrt{x'^2 + 1}$$\n\nwhere $x' = \\frac{dx}{dy}$. This gives us:\n\n$$T = \\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2g}}\\int_{0}^{y_2} dy \\dfrac{\\sqrt{x'^2 + 1}}{\\sqrt{y}}.$$\n\nWe can identify our function $f$ as:\n\n$$f(x,x',y) = f(x',y) = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{x'^2 + 1}}{\\sqrt{y}}.$$\n\nBecause $f$ does not depend on $x$, $\\partial f/\\partial x = 0$. So that the Euler-Lagrange equation simplifies to:\n\n$$\\dfrac{d}{dy}\\left(\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x'}\\right) = 0.$$\n\nOr that this partial derivative must be a constant:\n\n$$\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x'} = \\textrm{a constant},$$\n\n$$\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x'} = \\dfrac{x'}{\\sqrt{x'^2 + 1}\\sqrt{y}} = \\sqrt{C},$$\n\nwhere $C$ is a constant. We square both sides to get:\n\n$$\\dfrac{x'^2}{(x'^2 + 1)y} = C.$$\n\nKnowing the solution ahead of time, we choose the constant $C = \\frac{1}{2a}$. This gives us:\n\n$$\\dfrac{x'^2}{(x'^2 + 1)y} = \\frac{1}{2a}.$$\n\nSome more algebra gives us:\n\n$$2ax'^2 = y(x'^2 + 1),$$\n$$(2a - y)x'^2 = y,$$\n$$x'^2 = \\frac{y}{2a - y},$$\n\nwhere $x' = \\frac{dx}{dy}$. We can now integrate this to find the shape of the curve:\n\n$$x = \\int \\sqrt{\\frac{y}{2a - y}} dy.$$\n\nThis integral will give us the shape of the curve $x(y)$, but to solve it we need to use a substitution. \n\nLet $y = a(1 - \\cos(\\theta))$. Thus, $dy = a\\sin(\\theta)d\\theta$. This gives us:\n\n$$x(y(\\theta)) = \\int \\sqrt{\\frac{y(\\theta)}{2a - y(\\theta)}} dy$$\n$$x(y(\\theta)) = \\int \\sqrt{\\frac{a(1 - \\cos(\\theta))}{2a - a(1 - \\cos(\\theta))}} a\\sin(\\theta)d\\theta$$\n$$x(y(\\theta)) = a \\int \\sqrt{\\frac{(1-\\cos\\theta)}{(1+\\cos\\theta)}} \\sin(\\theta)d\\theta.$$\n\nNote that $\\sin \\theta = \\sqrt{1 - \\cos^2 \\theta} = \\sqrt{(1 - \\cos\\theta)(1 + \\cos\\theta)}$. This allows us to simplify the integral:\n\n$$x(y(\\theta)) = a \\int \\sqrt{\\frac{(1-\\cos\\theta)^2(1+\\cos\\theta)}{(1+\\cos\\theta)}} d\\theta$$\n$$x(y(\\theta)) = a \\int \\sqrt{(1 - \\cos\\theta)^2} d\\theta$$\n$$x(y(\\theta)) = a \\int (1 - \\cos\\theta) d\\theta$$\n$$x(y(\\theta)) = a \\left(\\theta - \\sin(\\theta)\\right) + C$$\n\nwhere $C$ is a constant of integration. \n\nWith initial conditions $x(0) = 0$ when $y(0) = 0$ at $t=0$ and $\\theta = 0$, we find that $C = 0$. So the solution is:\n\n$$x(\\theta) = a\\left(\\theta - \\sin(\\theta)\\right)$$\n$$y(\\theta) = a(1 - \\cos(\\theta)).$$\n\nThis is the \"cycloid\" curve that the bead will follow to minimize the time it takes to roll down the track. We can plot this curve to visualize it.\n\nWhat is so interesting about this curve is that it is [isochronous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isochronous), meaning that all beads released from rest at any point on the curve will reach the bottom at the same time, regardless of where they start.\n\n\n```python\n## Plot a cycloid path for comparison\n## $$x(\\theta) = a\\left(\\theta - \\sin(\\theta)\\right)$$\n## $$y(\\theta) = a(1 - \\cos(\\theta)).$$\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8-colorblind')\n\n# Cycloid parameters\na = 1  # Radius of the rolling circle\ntheta = np.linspace(0, 3/2 * np.pi, 1000)  # Parameter for the cycloid\n\n# Cycloid equations\nx_cycloid = a * (theta - np.sin(theta))\ny_cycloid = -a * (1 - np.cos(theta))\n\n# Create the plot\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 4))  # Create a new figure and axis\nax.plot(x_cycloid, y_cycloid, color='C0')\nax.plot(0, 0, 'C1o', label='Start')  # Starting point of the cycloid\nax.plot(x_cycloid[-1], y_cycloid[-1], 'C2o', label='End')  # Ending point of the cycloid\n\n# Set labels and title\nax.set_xlabel('x')\nax.set_ylabel('y')\nax.set_title('Cycloid Path')\n\nax.legend()  # Add a legend to the plot\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.grid(True)  # Add grid for better readability\nplt.show()  # Display the plot\n```\n\n\n    \n![png](11_notes_files/11_notes_10_0.png)\n    \n\n\n\n"

        "# Week 12 - The Principle of Least Action\n\n[Newtonian Mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion) is an incredibly useful model of the natural world. In fact, it wasn't until the mid 1970s that we were able to truly [test Einstein's gravity as a true replacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tests_of_general_relativity) for Newton. That being said, for most terrestrial situations (macroscopic objects moving at low speeds), Newton's mechanics is very good. However, the problem with Newton is that it requires a few things:\n\n1. We must be able identify each interaction on the object or model an average behavior from many smaller interactions (e.g., models of friction vs. detailed E&M forces)\n2. We must be able to mathematically describe the size and direction of the interaction at all times we want to model\n3. We must be able to vectorially add the interactions to produce the net force $\\sum_i \\vec{F}_i = \\vec{F}_{net}$.\n\nIn many cases, we can do this. But consider a bead sliding inside a cone. How would you write down the contact force between the cone and the bead for all space and time?\n\nThis is where [Lagrangian Mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics) comes in. It is a powerful and elegant way to describe the motion of particles and systems. It is based on the [Calculus of Variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations), a field of mathematics that is concerned with finding the path that minimizes or maximizes (called \"extremization\") a certain quantity. In the case of Lagrangian Mechanics, the quantity we are extremizing is the [action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_(physics)).\n\nThe video below discusses the concept of the Principle of Least Action, which is the foundation of Lagrangian Mechanics.\n\n[![The Principle of Least Action](../images/notes/week12/Q_CQDSlmboA.jpg)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Q_CQDSlmboA)\n\nSource: <https://youtube.com/watch?v=Q_CQDSlmboA>\n\n## Introduction to Lagrangian Dynamics (10 minute video)\n\nThe concept of Lagrangian dynamics can be a bit abstract at first, especially if you are used to Newtonian mechanics. The basic idea is that instead of focusing on forces, we focus on the kinetic and potential energy of the system to derive the equations of motion. The procedure to compute the equations of motion is straghtforward, but the set up of these problems can be tricky at first. \n\nThe basic steps are:\n1. **Identify the generalized coordinates**: These are the variables that describe the configuration of the system (e.g., angles, distances).\n2. **Write down the Lagrangian**: The Lagrangian $\\mathcal{L}$ is defined as the difference between the kinetic energy $T$ and potential energy $V$ of the system: \n   $$ \\mathcal{L} = T - V $$\n3. **Apply the Euler-Lagrange equations**: The equations of motion are derived from the Lagrangian using the Euler-Lagrange equations:\n    $$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\dot{q}_i} \\right) - \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial q_i} = 0 $$\n    where $q_i$ are the generalized coordinates and $\\dot{q}_i$ are their time derivatives (velocities).\n\nBut we need practice applying these steps to get comfortable with the process. Parth G. has a lovely video below about the basics of Lagrangian Dynamics. We will do a lot of this in class and go over many examples. This video is a nice introduction to the concept.\n\n[![Introduction to Lagrangian Dynamics](../images/notes/week12/KpLno70oYHE.jpg)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=KpLno70oYHE)\n\nSource: <https://youtube.com/watch?v=KpLno70oYHE>\n\n\n"

        "# Week 12 - Notes: Introduction to Lagrangian Mechanics \n\n\n\n\n## Deriving Newton's Second Law in Plane Polar Coordinates\n\nTo get started with Lagrangian mechanics, we will start by deriving Newton's second law in plane polar coordinates. This is not a necessary step for anything we will do in Lagrangian mechanics, but it is a good way to get comfortable with the coordinate system. And it will also help us see how we can think about forces in a coordinate system that is not Cartesian because Lagrangian mechanics can be used with [generalized coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_coordinates).\n\nWe start by sketching the location of a particle in plane polar coordinates, as shown below:\n\n![Position vector in polar coordinates](../images/notes/week12/coordinate-system.png)\n\nThe red arrow represents the position vector $\\vec{r}$, which is a length $r$ from the origin at an angle $\\phi$ from the $x$-axis. At the tip of the vector we have drawn the Cartesian unit vectors $\\hat{x}$ and $\\hat{y}$ in blue, and the polar unit vectors $\\hat{r}$ and $\\hat{\\phi}$ in green. Notice that the polar unit vectors are rotated by an angle $\\phi$ from the Cartesian unit vectors. We can simply write the position vector in terms of these unit vectors as:\n\n$$\n\\vec{r} = r \\hat{r} \\;\\text{where}\\; r = |\\vec{r}|.\n$$\n\nWe start by taking the derivative of the position vector $\\vec{r}$ with respect to time $t$ to find the velocity $\\vec{v}$. Using the product and chain rules, we have:\n\n$$\n\\dfrac{d\\vec{r}}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(r \\hat{r}) = \\dot{r} \\hat{r} + r \\frac{d\\hat{r}}{dt}.\n$$\n\nWhat is $\\frac{d\\hat{r}}{dt}$?\n\nWe note that the green unit vectors for $\\hat{r}$ and $\\hat{\\phi}$ are not constant, they change direction as the particle moves. We can write them in terms of the Cartesian unit vectors, which do not change with time, as follows:\n\n$$\n\\hat{r} = \\cos(\\phi) \\hat{x} + \\sin(\\phi) \\hat{y}, \\;\\;\\;\\; \\hat{\\phi} = -\\sin(\\phi) \\hat{x} + \\cos(\\phi) \\hat{y}.\n$$\n\nNow, we differentiate $\\hat{r}$ with respect to time $t$ using the chain rule:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d\\hat{r}}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\cos(\\phi) \\hat{x} + \\sin(\\phi) \\hat{y}) = -\\sin(\\phi) \\dot{\\phi} \\hat{x} + \\cos(\\phi) \\dot{\\phi} \\hat{y} = \\dot{\\phi} \\hat{\\phi}\n$$\n\nSo our expression for the velocity becomes:\n\n$$\n\\vec{v} = \\dot{r} \\hat{r} + r \\dot{\\phi} \\hat{\\phi}.\n$$\n\nWe differentiate again to find the acceleration $\\vec{a} = \\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt}$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\dot{r} \\hat{r} + r \\dot{\\phi} \\hat{\\phi}) = \\ddot{r} \\hat{r} + \\dot{r} \\frac{d\\hat{r}}{dt} + \\dot{r} \\dot{\\phi} \\hat{\\phi} + r \\ddot{\\phi} \\hat{\\phi} + r \\dot{\\phi} \\frac{d\\hat{\\phi}}{dt}\n$$\n\nRecall from above that $\\frac{d\\hat{r}}{dt} = \\dot{\\phi} \\hat{\\phi}$. Now, let's find $\\frac{d\\hat{\\phi}}{dt}$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d\\hat{\\phi}}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(-\\sin(\\phi) \\hat{x} + \\cos(\\phi) \\hat{y}) = -\\cos(\\phi) \\dot{\\phi} \\hat{x} - \\sin(\\phi) \\dot{\\phi} \\hat{y} = -\\dot{\\phi} \\hat{r}\n$$\n\nSubstituting these results, the acceleration becomes:\n\n<!-- $$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\vec{a} &= \\ddot{r} \\hat{r} + \\dot{r} (\\dot{\\phi} \\hat{\\phi}) + \\dot{r} \\dot{\\phi} \\hat{\\phi} + r \\ddot{\\phi} \\hat{\\phi} + r \\dot{\\phi} (-\\dot{\\phi} \\hat{r}) \\\\\n&= \\ddot{r} \\hat{r} + 2\\dot{r} \\dot{\\phi} \\hat{\\phi} + r \\ddot{\\phi} \\hat{\\phi} - r \\dot{\\phi}^2 \\hat{r} \\\\\n&= (\\ddot{r} - r \\dot{\\phi}^2) \\hat{r} + (2 \\dot{r} \\dot{\\phi} + r \\ddot{\\phi}) \\hat{\\phi}\n\\end{align*}\n$$ -->\n\nUsing Newton's second law, $\\vec{a} = \\vec{F}/m$, we have:\n\n$$\n\\vec{F}_{net} = m\\left[(\\ddot{r} - r \\dot{\\phi}^2) \\hat{r} + (2 \\dot{r} \\dot{\\phi} + r \\ddot{\\phi}) \\hat{\\phi}\\right]\n$$\n\nSo the radial and angular components of the net force are:\n\n$$\n\\vec{F}_{r} = m(\\ddot{r} - r \\dot{\\phi}^2) \\hat{r}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\vec{F}_{\\phi} = m(2 \\dot{r} \\dot{\\phi} + r \\ddot{\\phi}) \\hat{\\phi}\n$$\n\nThis gives us the net force in terms of the radial and angular components in polar coordinates.\n\n\n\n### Skateboard Example\n\nLet's see the utility of using polar coordinates by applying it to a skateboarder moving on a circular track. In this case, the skateboarder is constrained to move along a circular path of radius $r$. Consider a skateboarder moving on that circular track as shown below:\n\n![Skateboarder on a circular track](../images/notes/week12/skateboard.png)\n\nAt this point in the track, we can draw the free body diagram of the skateboarder. The forces acting on the skateboarder are the Earth's gravitational force and the normal force of the ramp.\n\n![Free body diagram of skateboarder](../images/notes/week12/skateboard-free-body.png)\n\nWe can use Newton's law in polar coordinates to analyze the forces acting on the skateboarder. This is because the normal force is always perpendicular to the surface of the ramp and will only have a radial component in polar coordinates. Thus we need only decompose the gravitational force into its radial and angular components.\n\nThe sum of all forces in the radial direction are given by:\n\n$$\\sum F_r = ma_r = -F_{ramp} + mg \\cos(\\phi) = m\\left(\\ddot{r} - r \\dot{\\phi}^2\\right)$$\n\nWe note that $r=R$, that is the radius is fixed, so \n\n$$\\ddot{r} = 0.$$\n\nTherefore, we can simplify the equation to:\n\n$$-F_{ramp} + mg \\cos(\\phi) = -mR \\dot{\\phi}^2.$$\n\nIn the tangential direction, we have:\n\n$$\\sum F_{\\phi} = ma_{\\phi} = -mg \\sin(\\phi) = m\\left(2 \\dot{r} \\dot{\\phi} + r \\ddot{\\phi}\\right)$$\n\nBecause $r=R$ is constant, we have $\\dot{r} = 0$. Thus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n$$-mg \\sin(\\phi) = mR \\ddot{\\phi}$$\n\nOr, we can express this as:\n\n$$\\ddot{\\phi} = -\\frac{g}{R} \\sin(\\phi).$$\n\n#### The Normal Force as a Function of Time\n\nWe can solve this equation using numerical methods to find $\\phi(t)$, the angular position of the skateboarder as a function of time. This can be used to then find the normal force as a function of time by substituting $\\phi(t)$ back into the radial equation we derived above:\n\n$$F_{ramp} = mg \\cos(\\phi(t)) + mR \\dot{\\phi}^2(t).$$\n\nNote that this force is a [force of constraint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_force) because it is not an external force acting on the skateboarder but rather a force that arises from the constraint of the circular track. These forces are important in mechanics and can be analyzed using Lagrangian mechanics as well. They are not typically conservative forces and do not have a potential energy associated with them. \n\n#### Simple Harmonic Motion\n\nIf we consider small angles, i.e., $\\sin(\\phi) \\approx \\phi$, then the equation of motion for $\\ddot{\\phi}$ becomes:\n\n$$\\ddot{\\phi} \\approx -\\frac{g}{R} \\phi.$$\non (SHM) with angular frequency $\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{R}}$. Thus, for small angles, the motion of the skateboarder on the circular track will exhibit SHM. The solution to this equation will be:\n\n$$\\phi(t) = A \\cos(\\omega t) + B \\sin(\\omega t),$$\n\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants determined by the initial conditions of the problem.\n\n### Newton's Laws and Equations of Motion\n\nSo far you have studied the work of physics from the perspective of Newtonian Mechanics, which is based on forces and their effects on motion. The idea behind using Newton's Laws is that:\n\n1. We can identify all the interactions with a body (i.e., all the forces and torques acting on it).\n2. We can write models of those interactions as mathematical expressions (i.e., force laws like $\\vec{F} = -k \\vec{x}$ for a spring or $b v^2$ for drag).\n3. We can vectorially sum all the individual interactions to find the net result (i.e., $\\sum \\vec{F}_i = \\vec{F}_{net}$).\n4. We can then use Newton's second law to find the acceleration of the body, $\\vec{a} = \\frac{\\vec{F}_{net}}{m}$.\n\nThis process has produced our **[equations of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_motion)** for a system. Which we then investigated in detail throughout the course. \n\n```{admonition} Spring Example\nWe have solved the spring problem many times using Newton's Laws. The spring ($k$) is attached to a block of mass $m$ on a frictionless surface. There is a dashpot connected to the block with a damping coefficient $b$. We know the drag force is opposite the motion. We can write:\n\n$$F_{spring} = -k x$$\n\n$$F_{drag} = -b v$$\n\nThus, the net force on the block is:\n\n$$F_{net} = F_{spring} + F_{drag} = -k \\vec{x} - b \\vec{v}$$\n\n\nWe can then substitute this into Newton's second law to find the acceleration of the block:\n\n$$a = \\frac{F_{net}}{m} = -\\frac{k}{m} x - \\frac{b}{m} v$$\n\nAnd thus our equation of motion for the block is:\n\n$$\\ddot{x} = -\\frac{k}{m} x - \\frac{b}{m} \\dot{x}$$\n```\n\n## Lagrangian Mechanics\n\nThe Lagrangian Formulation is rooted in classical optimization, but it is equivalent to Newton's work. However, it uses energy (a scalar) to do so. This means we can exploit coordinate transformations that do not change the scalar value of the energy.\n\nEpistemologically, Lagrange's approach is an exploration of phase space to determine paths the dynamical system can take. You can think of this as one level of abstraction above plotting the known phase space, because we don't yet have the equations of motion. \n\nLet's try an example we have seen before, the spring-mass system. \n\n### Example: Spring-Mass System\n\nAs you will learn, to get the EOM for a non-dissipative system, we form a function called the **Lagrangian**:\n\nThe Lagrangian is defined as:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L} = T - V\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $T$ is the **kinetic energy** of the system.\n- $V$ is the **potential energy** of the system.\n\nFor a 1D spring-mass system, we have:\n\n$$T = \\frac{1}{2} m \\dot{x}^2 \\quad V = \\frac{1}{2} k x^2$$\n\nNow we follow the optimization routine, which is applying the Euler-Lagrange equations to the Lagrangian. The Euler-Lagrange equation for $\\mathcal{L}(x,\\dot{x},t)$ is given by:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\dot{x}} \\right) - \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x} = 0.\n$$\n\nOur Lagrangian for the spring-mass system is:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}(x, \\dot{x}) = T - V = \\frac{1}{2} m \\dot{x}^2 - \\frac{1}{2} k x^2$$\n\nNow we can compute the necessary derivatives:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\dot{x}} = m \\dot{x}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x} = -k x$$\n\nNow we can substitute these into the Euler-Lagrange equation:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( m \\dot{x} \\right) - (-k x) = 0\n$$\n\n$$m\\ddot{x} + kx = 0$$\n\nThis is the same equation of motion we derived using Newton's laws for the spring-mass system.\n\n$$\\ddot{x} = -\\frac{k}{m} x$$\nThis shows that Lagrangian mechanics can reproduce the same equations of motion as Newtonian mechanics, but it does so by focusing on the energy of the system rather than forces directly. \n\n### Why does this work?\n\nLagrangian mechanics works because it is based on the [principle of least action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_principles) (or stationary action). This principle states that the actual path taken by a system between two points in phase space is the one that [minimizes (or makes stationary) the action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton%27s_principle), which is the integral of the Lagrangian over time.\n\nThis is not magic, it's an application of the [calculus of variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations). The action is a functional, and the Euler-Lagrange equations provide a way to find the stationary points of that functional. By applying these equations to the Lagrangian, we can derive the equations of motion for a system.\n\nWe can think of this as a system that evolves in time, but does so in a way that is optimal in some sense. The approach allows us to find the path the system will take by exploiting [Hamilton's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton%27s_principle): *The path taken by a dynamical system between two points in phase space is the one that minimizes the time integral of the Lagrangian*. \n\nMathematically, \n\n$$\\delta \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \\mathcal{L}(x(t), \\dot{x}(t), t) dt = 0$$\n\nWhere $\\delta$ indicates that we are looking for a stationary point of the action integral. This is precisely the formulation of the calculus of variations, which allows us to find the path that minimizes (or makes stationary) the action integral.\n\nSo, we know that the equation that will produce the $\\mathcal{L}$ that minimizes the action integral is given by the Euler-Lagrange equations. \n\n$$\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\dot{x}} \\right) - \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x} = 0$$\n\nIn fact, this approach holds in each Cartesian coordinate, so that the equations of motion can be derived in any coordinate system. \n\n$$\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\dot{x}_i} \\right) - \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x_i} = 0$$\n\nwhere $x_i$ can be $x, y, z$ if $\\mathcal{L}(x,y,z,\\dot{x},\\dot{y},\\dot{z},t)$.\n\n\n### Generalized Coordinates\n\nAs it turns out, our approach can make use of an phase coordinate $(\\theta, \\phi, x, y, \\rho, z, \\ldots)$ and their first derivatives $(\\dot{\\theta}, \\dot{\\phi}, \\dot{x}, \\dot{y}, \\dot{\\rho}, \\dot{z}, \\ldots)$. In fact, we can do so for any set of [generalized coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_coordinates) that describe the configuration of a system. Generalized coordinates are a set of coordinates that uniquely define the configuration of a system relative to some reference configuration. We denote them as $q_i$ where $i$ runs from 1 to $n$, and their time derivatives as $\\dot{q}_i$.\n\nThe generalized position is given by:\n\n$$\\vec{q} = (q_1, q_2, \\ldots, q_n)$$\n\nAnd the generalized velocity (or time derivative of the generalized coordinates) is given by:\n\n$$\\vec{\\dot{q}} = \\left(\\dot{q}_1, \\dot{q}_2, \\ldots, \\dot{q}_n\\right)$$\n\nThese $N$ coordinates would give tise to a set of $N$ equations of motion (subject to potential reductions due to constraints). The Lagrangian can be expressed in terms of these generalized coordinates and velocities:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L} = \\mathcal{L}(q_1, q_2, \\ldots, q_n, \\dot{q}_1, \\dot{q}_2, \\ldots, \\dot{q}_n, t)\n$$\n\nThe Euler-Lagrange equations can then be applied to each generalized coordinate $q_i$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\dot{q}_i} \\right) - \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial q_i} = 0, \\quad i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n\n$$\n\n## Example: Plane Pendulum\n\nTo get some intuition for how Lagrangian mechanics works, let's consider an example we have seen before: the plane pendulum.\n\nA pendulum bob of mass $m$ is attached to a fixed point by a rod of length $l$. The bob swings in a vertical plane under the influence of gravity as shown below. We define $U=0$ at the top of ceiling where the rod is attached.\n\n![Pendulum Diagram](../images/notes/week12/plane-pendulum.png)\n\nThe location of the bob is $\\langle x, y \\rangle$. We can use the $x,y$ coordinates to \"naively\" setup the Lagrangian and see what happens.\n\nThe kinetic energy $T$ of the pendulum bob is given by:\n\n$$T(\\dot{x}, \\dot{y}) = \\frac{1}{2} m (\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2).$$\n\nThe potential energy $V$ of the pendulum bob is given by:\n\n$$V(x,y) = +mgy.$$\n\nNote $y$ is negative in the downward direction.\n\nSo we can write the Lagrangian $\\mathcal{L}$ as:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(x, y, \\dot{x}, \\dot{y}) = T - V = \\frac{1}{2} m (\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2) - mgy\n$$\n\nWe will get two equations of motion from the Euler-Lagrange equations, one for $x$ and one for $y$. For $x$, we have:\n\n$$\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\dot{x}} \\right) - \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x} = 0$$\n$$\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( m \\dot{x} \\right) = 0.$$\n\nThis suggests that the momentum in the $x$-direction ($p_x= m\\dot{x}$) is conserved, which cannot be correct for a pendulum. \n\nFor $y$, we have:\n\n$$\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\dot{y}} \\right) - \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial y} = 0$$\n$$\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( m \\dot{y} \\right) - (-mg) = 0$$\n$$m\\ddot{y} + mg = 0$$\n$$\\ddot{y} = -g.$$\n\nThere's no tension force? That can't be right. \n\n**We failed to include the constraint of the pendulum!** The pendulum is constrained to move along a circular arc of radius $l$. This means that the coordinates $x$ and $y$ are not independent, and we cannot just use $x,y$ as coordinates. This is a classic example of why we need to use generalized coordinates in Lagrangian mechanics.\n\nThe constraint for the pendulum is given by:\n\n$$x^2 + y^2 = l^2$$\n\nThis tells us that,\n\n$$\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2 = \\dot{r}^2 + r^2 \\dot{\\phi}^2 = l^2 \\dot{\\phi}^2$$\n\nwhere $r=l$ is constant. So the constraint tells us that the motion of the pendulum is constrained to a circle of radius $l$ and it provides a relationship between the velocities $\\dot{x}$ and $\\dot{y}$.\n\nSo as you might have guessed, we need to use a different coordinate system to describe the motion of the pendulum. We can use **plane polar coordinates** $(r, \\phi)$ where $r=l$ is constant and $\\phi$ is the angle from the vertical.\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}(x, y, \\dot{x}, \\dot{y}) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{L}(r, \\phi, \\dot{r}, \\dot{\\phi})$$\n\nThe kinetic energy $T$ in polar coordinates is given by:\n\n$$T = \\frac{1}{2} m \\left( \\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2 \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} ml^2\\dot{\\phi}^2 = T(\\dot{r}, \\dot{\\phi}).$$\n\nThe potential energy $V$ becomes:\n\n$$V = mgy = - mg l \\cos(\\phi) = V(r, \\phi)$$\n\nNow we can write the Lagrangian $\\mathcal{L}$ in terms of the polar coordinates:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(r, \\phi, \\dot{r}, \\dot{\\phi}) = T - V = \\frac{1}{2} m l^2 \\dot{\\phi}^2 + mgl \\cos(\\phi)\n$$\n\nNotice that it is actually only a function of $\\phi$ and $\\dot{\\phi}$, because $r=l$ is constant.\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}(l, \\phi, \\dot{\\phi}) = \\frac{1}{2} m l^2 \\dot{\\phi}^2 - mgl \\cos(\\phi)$$\n\nThus, we have a 1D equation of motion. This makes sense because the pendulum is constrained to move in a circular arc, and we can describe its motion using just one coordinate $\\phi$.\n\nNow we can apply the Euler-Lagrange equation to find the equation of motion for $\\phi$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\dot{\\phi}} \\right) - \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\phi} = 0\n$$\n\n$$-mgl \\sin(\\phi) + \\frac{d}{dt} (ml^2 \\dot{\\phi}) = 0$$\n\nAnd thus the $\\phi$ equation of motion becomes:\n\n$$ml^2 \\ddot{\\phi} + mgl \\sin(\\phi) = 0$$\n\nor,\n\n$$\\ddot{\\phi} = - \\frac{g}{l} \\sin(\\phi).$$\n\nAs we have seen, for small $\\phi$, this reduces to simple harmonic motion:\n\n$$\\ddot{\\phi} \\approx -\\frac{g}{l} \\phi \\quad \\text{for small } \\phi.$$\n\n\n"

        "# Week 13 - Lagrangian Mechanics\n\nThe Lagrangian formulation of mechanics allows us to describe the motion of a system in terms of its kinetic and potential energy, rather than its forces. This approach is particularly useful for systems with constraints or when dealing with generalized coordinates. There's a few general concepts that arise in Lagrangian mechanics that make it a powerful tool for analyzing mechanical systems.\n\nFirst, the Lagrangian formulation emphasizes the idea of independent coordinates while also providing the flexibility to use any set of coordinates that are convenient for the problem at hand. This is in contrast to Newtonian mechanics, which often relies clearly structured position and velocity vectors. \n\nBecause the Lagrangian uses this generalized coordinate system, it is often easier to analyze complex systems with many degrees of freedom. Moreover, when dealing with constraints, the Lagrangian formulation allows us to incorporate these constraints directly into the equations of motion, which reduces the dimensionality of the problem.\n\nIn addition, the Lagrangian formulation is particularly useful for systems with symmetries. By applying [Noether's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether%27s_theorem), we can relate symmetries of the system to conserved quantities, which can simplify the analysis of the system's motion. For example, if a particular system is invariant under time translations (for us no explicit time dependence in $\\mathcal{L}$), we can conclude that energy is conserved. If a coordinate is cyclic (e.g., no $x$ dependence in $\\mathcal{L}$), we can conclude that the corresponding momentum (in this example, $p_x$) is conserved.\n\nLastly, the formalism produces [generalized forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_force) that are not necessarily equal to the physical forces acting on the system, but have corresponding generalized momenta. These are always produced in our equations of motion, but they might not be forces or momenta that we can measure directly, or that we can even define as a \"force\", some are torques, for example. \n\nConsider an $N$ dimensional system with $N$ generalized coordinates $q_i$ and $N$ generalized velocities $\\dot{q}_i$. The Lagrangian is defined as the difference between the kinetic energy $T$ and the potential energy $V$ of the system:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L} = T(\\dot{q}_1, \\dot{q}_2, \\dots, \\dot{q}_N) - V(q_1, q_2, \\dots, q_N)\n$$\n\nThe derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to a generalized coordinate $q_i$ is given by:\n\n$$\\dfrac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial q_i} = \\dfrac{\\partial V}{\\partial q_i} = F_{q_i}$$\n\nwhere $F_{q_i}$ is the generalized force conjugate to the coordinate $q_i$.\n\nThe derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to a generalized velocity $\\dot{q}_i$ is given by:\n\n$$\\dfrac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\dot{q}_i} = \\dfrac{\\partial T}{\\partial \\dot{q}_i} = p_{q_i}$$\n\nwhere $p_{q_i}$ is the generalized momentum conjugate to the coordinate $q_i$.\n\n## The Standard Model Lagrangian (17 minute video)\n\nAn understanding of physics formulated through [Lagrangian Mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics) is a powerful and elegant way to describe the motion of particles and systems. But it can be much more than that. Much of the work of particle physics is done in the context of the [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model). The Standard Model is a theory that describes the electromagnetic, weak, and strong nuclear interactions. The Standard Model is a [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory), which is formulated through a Lagrangian.\n\nThe video below provides an introduction to this equation and the Standard Model.\n\n[![Standard Model Lagrangian](../images/notes/week13/PHiyQID7SBs.jpg)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=PHiyQID7SBs)\n\n\n\n"

        "# Week 13 - Notes: Examples of Lagrangian Mechanics\n\n\n\nWe've seen the Lagrangian formulation of mechanics, and we have seen how to use it to derive the equations of motion for a system. We will cover a few common examples of Lagrangian mechanics and point out some of the subtleties that arise in each case.\n\n## Example: The Atwood Machine\n\nThe [Atwood machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atwood_machine) consists of two masses, $M$ and $m$, connected by a massless string that passes over a massless pulley. The system is subject to gravity alone. The figure below shows the system along with a choice of coordinates $y_1$ and $y_2$ for the two masses. \n\n![Atwood Machine](../images/notes/week13/atwood.png)\n\nThese coordinates are measured from the center of the pulley and positive $y_1$ and $y_2$ are taken to be upward. Let's try to use the Lagrangian formalism to find the equations of motion for this system.\n\n$$V = + Mgy_1 + mgy_2$$\n\n$$T = \\dfrac{1}{2}M\\dot{y}_1^2 + \\dfrac{1}{2}m\\dot{y}_2^2$$\n\n### Equation of Constraint\n\nBut notice that $y_1$ and $y_2$ are no independent coordinates. If we unravel the string that is over the pulley, we find that (assume length of string is $l$):\n\n$$y_1 + \\pi R + y_2 = l$$\n\nwhere $R$ is the radius of the pulley. That is shown in the figure below.\n\n![Unraveled String](../images/notes/week13/string-unraveled.png)\n\nThe equation above is called an **equation of constraint**. It relates the coordinates $y_1$ and $y_2$ to each other. We can use this equation to eliminate one of the coordinates. Let's eliminate $y_2$:\n\n$$l = y_1 + \\pi R + y_2 \\rightarrow y_1 = (l - \\pi R) - y_2$$ \n\nThis constraint has implications for velocities,\n\n$$\\dfrac{dy_1}{dt} = \\dfrac{d}{dt}\\left((l-\\pi R) - y_2\\right) = -\\dfrac{dy_2}{dt}$$\n\n$$\\dot{y}_1 = -\\dot{y}_2.$$\n\nThis is likely what we could have expected, that the two masses move in opposite directions at the same speed.\n\n### Constructing the Lagrangian\n\nLet's use this constraint to reduce the number of coordinates in the Lagrangian. \n\n$$\\mathcal{L}(y_1, y_2, \\dot{y}_1, \\dot{y}_2) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{L}(y_1, \\dot{y}_1)$$\n\nWe can do this by substituting $y_2$ in terms of $y_1$ into the energy equations:\n\n$$T(y_1, \\dot{y}_1) = \\dfrac{1}{2}M\\dot{y}_1^2 + \\dfrac{1}{2}m\\dot{y}_2^2 = \\dfrac{1}{2}(M+m)\\dot{y}_1^2 = T(\\dot{y}_1)$$\n\n$$V(y_1, y_2) = +Mgy_1 + mgy_2$$\n$$V(y_1, y_2) = Mgy_1 + mg((l-\\pi R) - y_1)$$\n$$V(y_1, y_2) = (M-m)g y_1 + mg(l-\\pi R)$$\n$$V(y_1, y_2) = (M-m)g y_1 + U_0$$\n\nwhere $U_0 = mg(l-\\pi R)$ is a constant and will not affect the equations of motion.\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}(y_1, \\dot{y}_1) = T(\\dot{y}_1) - V(y_1) = \\dfrac{1}{2}(M+m)\\dot{y}_1^2 - (M-m)g y_1$$\n\n$$\\dfrac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial y_1} = -(M-m)g$$\n\n$$\\dfrac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\dot{y}_1} = (M+m)\\dot{y}_1$$\n\nThese derivatives give the following equation of motion:\n\n$$-(M-m) g - \\dfrac{d}{dt}\\left((M+m)\\dot{y}_1\\right) = 0$$\n\n#### Generalized Force\n\nNotice that the first term in the above equation is the force on the mass $M$ in the Newtonian picture: the weight of $M$ minus the weight of $m$. That makes sense because the Lagrangian formalism is supposed to reproduce Newton's laws, and the spatial derivative of the Lagrangian produces a [generalized force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_force).\n\n$$\\dfrac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial q_i} = -\\dfrac{\\partial V}{\\partial q_i} = F_i$$\n\nThe kinetic term has no spatial dependence, so it does not contribute to the generalized force.\n\n#### Generalized Momentum\n\nThe second term in the above equation is the time derivative of the momentum of the system using $y_1$ as the coordinate:\n\n$$(M+m)\\dot{y}_1 = M\\dot{y}_1 - m\\dot{y}_2 = p_{y_1}$$\n\nAgain, that is a sensible result because the Lagrangian formalism is supposed to reproduce Newton's laws, and the generalized force is related to the time derivative of the [generalized momentum](https://phys.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Classical_Mechanics/Variational_Principles_in_Classical_Mechanics_(Cline)/07%3A_Symmetries_Invariance_and_the_Hamiltonian/7.02%3A_Generalized_Momentum).\n\n$$\\dfrac{d}{dt}\\left(\\dfrac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\dot{q}_i}\\right) = \\dfrac{d}{dt}\\left(\\dfrac{\\partial T}{\\partial \\dot{q}_i}\\right) = \\dfrac{dp_{q_i}}{dt}$$\n\n### Equation of Motion\n\nThe equation of motion can be written as\n\n$$(M=m)\\ddot{y}_1 = -(M-m)g$$\n$$\\ddot{y}_1 = -\\dfrac{(M-m)}{(M+m)}g.$$\n\nWith $M > m$, this acceleration is downward as the larger mass $M$ accelerates down. With $\\dot{y}_1 = -\\dot{y}_2$, we know $$\\ddot{y}_2 = -\\ddot{y}_1$$, so that:\n\n$$\\ddot{y}_2 = \\dfrac{(M-m)}{(M+m)}g$$\n\nAgain, with $M > m$, this acceleration is upward as the smaller mass $m$ accelerates up.\n\n## Example: Atwood Machine with Rotating Pulley\n\nIn the previous example, we didn't take into account the energy needed to rotate the pulley. Let's do that now. Beucase the rope cannot slip, any small rotation $Rd\\phi$ of the pulley give a change $dy_1$ in the position of mass $M$. This is the [no slip constraint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-slip_condition).\n\nIf the pulley has a mass $M_p$ and radius $R$, then we must introduce it's kinetic energy:\n\n$$T_{pulley} =  \\dfrac{1}{2} I \\omega^2$$\n\nwhere $I$ is the [moment of inertia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_moments_of_inertia) of the pulley and $\\omega$ is the angular velocity of the pulley, $\\omega = \\dot{\\phi}$. This angular velocity is related to the linear velocities of the masses.\n\n$$I = \\dfrac{1}{2}M_p R^2$$\n\n$$T_{pulley} =  \\dfrac{1}{2} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}M_p R^2\\right) \\dot{\\phi}^2$$\n$$T_{pulley} =  \\dfrac{1}{4}M_p R^2 \\dot{\\phi}^2$$\n\nWe now map this additional kinetic energy into the problem.\n\n$$T(\\dot{y}_1, \\dot{\\phi}) = \\dfrac{1}{2}(M+m)\\dot{y}_1^2 + \\dfrac{1}{4}M_p R^2 \\dot{\\phi}^2$$\n\nBut the constraint is such that, \n\n$$\\dot{y}_1 = Rd\\phi \\rightarrow y_1 = R\\phi +\\underbrace{R\\phi_0}_{\\textrm{const.}}$$\n\n$$\\dot{y}_1 = R\\dot{\\phi}$$\n\nWe work these back into $T$, $V$, and $\\mathcal{L}$.\n\n$$T(\\dot{\\phi}) = \\dfrac{1}{2}(M+m)\\dot{y}_1^2 + \\dfrac{1}{4}M_p R^2 \\dot{\\phi}^2$$\n$$T(\\dot{\\phi}) = \\dfrac{1}{2}(M+m+\\frac{1}{2}M_p)R^2 \\dot{\\phi}^2$$\n\n$$V(\\phi) = (M-m)gy_1 + U_0$$\n$$V(\\phi) = (M-m)g(R\\phi + R\\phi_0) + U_0$$\n$$V(\\phi) = (M-m)gR\\phi + \\tilde{U}_0$$\n\nwhere $\\tilde{U}_0 = (M-m)gR\\phi_0 + U_0$ is another constant that will not affect the equations of motion.\n\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}(\\phi, \\dot{\\phi}) = T(\\dot{\\phi}) - V(\\phi)$$\n$$\\mathcal{L}(\\phi, \\dot{\\phi}) = \\dfrac{1}{2}(M+m+\\frac{1}{2}M_p)R^2 \\dot{\\phi}^2 - (M-m)gR\\phi$$\n\n\n### Torque and Angular Momentum\n\nOur generalized coordinate is $\\phi$ and our generalized velocity is $\\dot{\\phi}$. We apply the Euler-Lagrange equation. We obtain the generalized force:\n\n$$\\dfrac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\phi} = -(M-m)gR = F_{\\phi}$$\n\nNotice that in this case, the generalized force is not the same as the force on mass $M$ in the Newtonian picture. It's a torque around the pulley.\n\nWe can find the generalized momentum in a similar way:\n\n$$\\dfrac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\dot{\\phi}} = (M+m+\\frac{1}{2}M_p)R^2\\dot{\\phi} = p_{\\phi}$$\n\nThis is the angular momentum of the system about the axle. We can see that by breaking down each part and adding them up.\n\n$$\\vec{L}_{total} = \\vec{L}_{disk} + \\vec{L}_{M} + \\vec{L}_{m}$$\n\n$$\\vec{L}_{disk} = I_{disk}\\omega = \\dfrac{1}{2}M_p R^2 \\dot{\\phi}\\,\\text{(out of the page)}$$\n\n$$\\vec{L}_{M} = M\\vec{r}_{M}\\times \\vec{v}_{M} = M(R\\hat{r})\\times (R\\dot{\\phi}\\hat{\\phi}) = MR^2 \\dot{\\phi}\\,\\text{(out of the page)}$$\n\n$$\\vec{L}_{m} = M\\vec{r}_{m}\\times \\vec{v}_{m} = m(R\\hat{r})\\times (R\\dot{\\phi}\\hat{\\phi}) = mR^2 \\dot{\\phi}\\,\\text{(out of the page)}$$\n\nAdd them up:\n\n$$\\vec{L}_{total} = \\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}M_p + M + m\\right)R^2 \\dot{\\phi}\\,\\text{(out of the page)}$$\n\nOr the magnitude:\n\n$$L_{total} = \\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}M_p + M + m\\right)R^2 \\dot{\\phi}$$\n$$p_{\\phi} = L_{total}$$\n\n### Equation of Motion\n\nWe return to the diffeferential equation of motion:\n\n$$-(M-m)gR - \\dfrac{d}{dt}((M+m+\\frac{1}{2}M_p)R^2\\dot{\\phi} = 0$$\n$$-(M-m)gR - (M+m+\\frac{1}{2}M_p)R^2\\ddot{\\phi} = 0$$\n\nwhich produces the following equation of motion:\n\n$$\\ddot{\\phi} = -\\dfrac{g}{R}\\dfrac{(M-m)}{(M+m+\\frac{1}{2}M_p)}$$\n\nwhich is a constant acceleration.\n\n## Example: Bead in a Parabolic Bowl\n\nA bead of mass $m$ is constrained to move along a parabolic bowl. There is a gravitational force acting on the bead. The bowl is symmetric about the $z$-axis and the bead is constrained to move along the surface without friction or rolling. The bowl is described by the equation:\n\n$$z = \\dfrac{1}{2}c(x^2 + y^2)$$\n\nwhere $c$ is a constant that describes the curvature of the bowl. The figure below shows the system.\n\n![Bead in a Parabolic Bowl](../images/notes/week13/paraboloid.png)\n\nIn this case the system is better solved in cylindrical coordinates. The coordinates are $(r, \\phi, z)$, where $r$ is the distance from the $z$-axis, $\\phi$ is the angle around the $z$-axis, and $z$ is the height above the $xy$-plane as shown above.\n\nWith $\\langle \\rho, \\phi, z\\rangle$ as the coordinates, equation for the constraint is:\n\n$$z = \\dfrac{1}{2}c(x^2 + y^2) = \\dfrac{1}{2}c\\rho^2.$$\n\nNote that $c$ has units.\n\n$$[z] = m \\quad [\\rho^2] = m^2 \\quad [c] = \\dfrac{1}{m}$$\n\nThe speed in cylindrical coordinates can be derived from the expressions in Cartesian coordinates, but we quote the result here:\n\n$$v^2 = \\dot{\\rho}^2 + \\rho^2\\dot{\\phi}^2 + \\dot{z}^2.$$\n\n### Constructing the Lagrangian\n\nWe write the kinetic and potential energy of the bead in terms of the coordinates $(r, \\phi, z)$.\n\n$$T = \\dfrac{1}{2}m\\left(\\dot{\\rho}^2 + \\rho^2\\dot{\\phi}^2 + \\dot{z}^2\\right)$$\n\n$$V = mgz$$\n\nIn principle, the Lagrangian can depend on all three coordinates and all three velocities. \n\n$$\\mathcal{L}(\\rho, \\dot{\\rho}, \\phi, \\dot{\\phi}, z, \\dot{z}, t) = T - V$$\n\nThere is no explicit time dependence, so we can ignore $t$. When the Lagrangian has no explicit time dependence, we should expect the energy to be conserved. This form of Lagrangian analysis does not account for dissipation.\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}(\\rho, \\dot{\\rho}, \\phi, \\dot{\\phi}, z, \\dot{z})$$\n\nMoreover, with the symmetry of the problem, we can expect no $\\phi$ dependence. That is the gravitational potential energy only depends on $z$ and not on $\\phi$. This is a consequence of the symmetry of the problem and indicates that $\\phi$ is a [cyclic coordinate](https://phys.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Classical_Mechanics/Variational_Principles_in_Classical_Mechanics_(Cline)/07%3A_Symmetries_Invariance_and_the_Hamiltonian/7.05%3A_Cyclic_Coordinates). We thus expect angular momentum to be conserved about the $z$-axis.\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}(\\rho, \\dot{\\rho}, \\dot{\\phi}, z, \\dot{z})$$\n\nLastly, the constraint equation gives us $z$ in terms of $\\rho$:\n\n$$z = \\dfrac{1}{2}c\\rho^2$$\n\nAnd thus we can find the time derivative of $z$:\n\n$$\\dot{z} = 2c\\rho\\dot{\\rho}.$$\n\nSo the Lagrangian can be simplified three variables:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}(\\rho, \\dot{\\rho}, \\dot{\\phi}) = T - V$$\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}(\\rho, \\dot{\\rho}, \\dot{\\phi}) = \\dfrac{1}{2}m\\left(\\dot{\\rho}^2 + \\rho^2\\dot{\\phi}^2 + 4c^2\\rho^2\\dot{\\rho}^2\\right) - mg\\dfrac{1}{2}c\\rho^2$$\n\n### Equations of Motion\n\nWe can now apply the Euler-Lagrange equations to find the equations of motion. We will do this for each coordinate. Let's start with $\\phi$ because there is only one term in the Lagrangian that depends on $\\dot{\\phi}$.\n\n$$\\underbrace{\\dfrac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\phi}}_0 - \\dfrac{d}{dt}\\left(\\dfrac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\dot{\\phi}}\\right) = 0$$\n\n$$\\dfrac{d}{dt}\\left(\\dfrac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\dot{\\phi}}\\right) = \\dfrac{d}{dt}\\underbrace{\\left(m\\rho^2\\dot{\\phi}\\right)}_{L_z} = 0$$\n\nThis equation of motion indicates that the angular momentum about the $z$-axis is conserved, as we expected from the symmetry of the problem.\n\nFor the coordinate $\\rho$, we have:\n\n$$\\dfrac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\rho} - \\dfrac{d}{dt}\\left(\\dfrac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\dot{\\rho}}\\right) = 0$$\n\n$$\\dfrac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\rho} = m\\rho\\dot{\\phi}^2 + 4c^2m\\rho\\dot{\\rho}^2 - 2mgc\\rho$$\n\n$$\\dfrac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\dot{\\rho}} = m\\dot{\\rho} + 4mc^2\\rho^2\\dot{\\rho}$$\n\n$$\\dfrac{d}{dt}\\left(\\dfrac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\dot{\\rho}}\\right) = m\\ddot{\\rho} + 8mc^2\\rho\\dot{\\rho}^2 + 4mc^2\\rho^2\\ddot{\\rho}$$\n\nWe can now write the equation of motion:\n\n$$m\\rho\\dot{\\phi}^2 + 4c^2m\\rho\\dot{\\rho}^2 - 2mgc\\rho - m\\ddot{\\rho} - 8mc^2\\rho\\dot{\\rho}^2 - 4mc^2\\rho^2\\ddot{\\rho} = 0$$\n\nWe can clean this up a little bit:\n\n$$\\ddot{\\rho}(1+4c^2\\rho^2) + 8c^2\\rho\\dot{\\rho}^2 = \\rho\\dot{\\phi}^2 + 4c^2\\rho\\dot{\\rho}^2 - 2gc\\rho$$\n\n$$\\ddot{\\rho}(1+4c^2\\rho^2) + 4c^2\\rho\\dot{\\rho}^2 - \\rho\\dot{\\phi}^2 + 2gc\\rho = 0$$\n\nWe try to write both equations in terms of their accelerations. We have:\n\n$$\\ddot{\\rho} = -\\dfrac{4c^2\\rho\\dot{\\rho}^2 - \\rho\\dot{\\phi}^2 + 2gc\\rho}{1+4c^2\\rho^2}$$\n\n$$\\ddot{\\phi} = - \\dfrac{2\\rho\\dot{\\rho}\\dot{\\phi}}{\\rho^2}$$\n\nFor which we can develop a solution anywhere away from the origin ($\\rho \\neq 0$). \n\n### Preparing for Numerical Solution\n\nWe need to write these equations in a form that is ready for numerical solution. We can do this by writing the equations in terms of the first derivatives. Let $\\omega = \\dot{\\phi}$ and $v = \\dot{\\rho}$. We get 4 1st order equations:\n\n$$\\dot{\\rho} = v$$\n$$\\dot{\\phi} = \\omega$$\n$$\\dot{v} = -\\dfrac{4c^2\\rho v^2 - \\rho\\omega^2 + 2gc\\rho}{1+4c^2\\rho^2}$$\n$$\\dot{\\omega} = - \\dfrac{2 v\\omega}{\\rho^2}$$\n\n\n"

You can work in groups (optimal groups are often 2-3 people) or by yourself. If you work as a group you can hand in one answer only if you wish. **Remember to write your name(s)**!\n2. Homeworks are available approximately ten days before the deadline. You should anticipate this work.\n3. How do I(we)  hand in?  You can hand in the paper and pencil exercises as a **single scanned PDF document**. For this homework this applies to exercises 1-5. Your jupyter notebook file should be converted to a **PDF** file, attached to the same PDF file as for the pencil and paper exercises. All files should be uploaded to Gradescope. \n\n**[Instructions for submitting to Gradescope](../resources/gradescope-submissions.md).**\n\n## Exercise 1 (15 pt), math reminder, properties of exponential function\n\nThe first exercise is meant to remind ourselves about properties of the exponential function and imaginary numbers. This is highly relevant later in this course when we start analyzing oscillatory motion and some wave mechanics. The discovery relating [trigonometric functions and exponential functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_formula) is attributed to [Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler). There's two great books on the development formula, its importance to math and science, its applications:\n\n- [Paul J. Nahin, *Dr. Euler's Fabulous Formula: Cures Many Mathematical Ills*, Princeton University Press (2006)](https://bookshop.org/p/books/dr-euler-s-fabulous-formula-cures-many-mathematical-ills-paul-j-nahin/9008263)\n- [David Stipp, *A Most Elegant Equation: Euler's Formula and the Beauty of Mathematics*, Basic Books (2017)](https://bookshop.org/p/books/a-most-elegant-equation-euler-s-formula-and-the-beauty-of-mathematics-david-stipp/11457298)\n\nAs physicists we should feel comfortable with expressions that include $\\exp{(\\imath \\omega t)}$ and $\\exp{(\\imath 2\\pi f t)}$. Here $t$ could be interpreted as time and $\\omega$/$f$ as a frequency. We know that $\\imath = \\sqrt(-1)$ is the imaginary unit number.\n\n* 1a (4pt): Perform Taylor expansions in powers of $2\\pi f t$ of the functions $\\cos{(2\\pi f t)}$ and $\\sin{(2\\pi f t)}$. Show your work in producing those Taylor expansions.\n* 1b (3pt): Perform a Taylor expansion of $\\exp{(i2\\pi f t)}$. Show your work in producing those Taylor expansions.\n* 1c (2pt): Using parts (a) and (b) here, show that $\\exp{(\\imath2\\pi f t)}=\\cos{(2\\pi f t)}+\\imath\\sin{(2\\pi f t)}$.\n* 1d (2pt): Show that $\\ln{(-1)} = \\imath\\pi$.\n* 1e (4pt): Develop another novel mathematical relationship based on the properties you've discovered in this problem. Explain how your result connects to any of the results parts a-d.\n\n## Exercise 2 (15 pt), Vector algebra\n\nAs we have quickly realized, forces and motion in three dimensions are best described using vectors. Here we perform some elementary vector algebra that we wil need to have as tacit knowledge for the rest of the course. These operations are not typically taken with specific numbers, but rather with vectors in general. When we need to, we use the notation $\\boldsymbol{a}=(a_x,a_y,a_z)$ for vectors in three dimensions. To get us started the first two questions below include numerical values, but the third question expects you to use the general notation.\n\n* 2a (4pt) One of the many uses of the scalar product is to find the angle between two given vectors. Find the angle between the vectors $\\boldsymbol{a}=(1,3,9)$ and $\\boldsymbol{b}=(9,3,1)$ by evaluating their scalar product.\n\n* 2b (5pt) For a cube with sides of length 1, one vertex at the origin, and sides along the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes, the vector of the body diagonal from the origin can be written $\\boldsymbol{a}=(1, 1, 1)$ and the vector of the face diagonal in the $xy$ plane from the origin is $\\boldsymbol{b}=(1,1,0)$. Find first the lengths of the body diagonal and the face diagonal. Use then part (2a) to find the angle between the body diagonal and the face diagonal. **Make sure to include a sketch of your cube, the relevant vectors, and the angle you find.**\n\n* 2c (6pt) Consider two arbitrary vectors in three dimensions, $\\boldsymbol{a}=(a_x, a_y, a_z)$ and $\\boldsymbol{b}=(b_x, b_y, b_z)$. Prove that the cross product $\\boldsymbol{a} \\times \\boldsymbol{b}$ results in a vector that is perpendicular to both $\\boldsymbol{a}$ and $\\boldsymbol{b}$. Use the properties of the dot product and the cross product to support your proof. Include a diagram illustrating the vectors and their cross product.\n\nThe notation that we use for vectors in fairly recently developed in mathematical history. The development of calculus, geometry, and physics in the 17th century required new notations. The [history of mathematical notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_mathematical_notation#High_division_operators_and_functions) is very interesting in that these tools and symbols that we developed helped us to solve new and more advanced problems. \n\n## Exercise 3 (10 pt), More vector mathematics\n\n* 3a (5pt) Show (using the fact that multiplication of reals is distributive) that $\\boldsymbol{a}\\cdot(\\boldsymbol{b}+\\boldsymbol{c})=\\boldsymbol{a}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{b}+\\boldsymbol{a}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{c}$.\n\n* 3b (5pt) Show that (using product rule for differentiating reals)  $\\frac{d}{dt}(\\boldsymbol{a}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{b})=\\boldsymbol{a}\\cdot\\frac{d\\boldsymbol{b}}{dt}+\\boldsymbol{b}\\cdot\\frac{d\\boldsymbol{a}}{dt}$\n\n## Exercise 4 (10 pt), Algebra of cross products\n\n* 4a (5pt) Show that the cross products are distribuitive $\\boldsymbol{a}\\times(\\boldsymbol{b}+\\boldsymbol{c})=\\boldsymbol{a}\\times\\boldsymbol{b}+\\boldsymbol{a}\\times\\boldsymbol{c}$.\n\n* 4b (5pt) Show that $\\frac{d}{dt}(\\boldsymbol{a}\\times\\boldsymbol{b})=\\boldsymbol{a}\\times\\frac{d\\boldsymbol{b}}{dt}+\\frac{d\\boldsymbol{a}}{dt}\\times \\boldsymbol{b}$. Be careful with the order of factors\n\n## Exercise 5 (10 pt), Area of triangle and law of sines\n\nThe three vectors $\\boldsymbol{a}$, $\\boldsymbol{b}$, and $\\boldsymbol{c}$ are the three sides of a triangle *ABC*. The angles $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$ are the angles opposite the sides $\\boldsymbol{a}$, $\\boldsymbol{b}$, and $\\boldsymbol{c}$, respectively. as shown below.\n\n![triangle](../images/activities/1.15-triangle.png)\n\n*(Figure: A triangle with sides $\\boldsymbol{a}$, $\\boldsymbol{b}$, and $\\boldsymbol{c}$ and angles $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$; reproduced from JRT.)*\n\n* 5a (5pt) Show that the area of the triangle can be given by any of these three equivalent expressions: $A=\\frac{1}{2}|\\boldsymbol{a}\\times\\boldsymbol{b}|=\\frac{1}{2}|\\boldsymbol{b}\\times\\boldsymbol{c}|=\\frac{1}{2}|\\boldsymbol{c}\\times\\boldsymbol{a}|$.\n\n* 5b (5pt) Use the equality of the three expressions for the area of the triangle to show that $\\frac{\\sin{\\alpha}}{a}=\\frac{\\sin{\\beta}}{b}=\\frac{\\sin{\\gamma}}{c}$, which is known as the [Law of Sines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_sines).\n\n## Exercise 6 (40pt), Numerical elements, getting started with some simple data\n\n**This exercise needs to be worked on in a Jupyter notebook, but should be handed in as a PDF**. Remember to write your name(s). \n\nOur first numerical attempt will involve reading data from file or just setting up two vectors, one for position and one for time. Our data are from  \n\n[![Usain Bolt's world record 100m during the olympic games in Beijing in\n2008](../images/activities/93dC0o2aHto.jpg)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=93dC0o2aHto)\n\n- Direct Link: [https://youtube.com/watch?v=93dC0o2aHto](https:curl//youtube.com/watch?v=93dC0o2aHto)\n\nThe data show the time used in units of 10m (see below). Before we however\nventure into this, we need to repeat some basic Python syntax with an\nemphasis on\n\n* basic Python syntax for arrays\n\n* define and operate on vectors and matrices in Python\n\n* create plots for motion in 1D space\n\nFor more information, see [this link to Python support materials](https://dannycaballero.info/phy321msu/lecture-notes/chapter2.html#python-practicalities-software-and-needed-installations).\nHere are some of the basic packages we will be using this week\n\n\n```python\n%matplotlib inline\n\nimport numpy as np \nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n```\n\nThe first exercise here deals with simply getting familiar with vectors and matrices.\n\nWe will be working with vectors and matrices to get you familiar with them.\n\n1. Initalize two three-dimensional $xyz$ vectors in the below cell using np.array([x,y,z]). Vectors are represented through arrays in python\n\n2. V1 should have x1=1, y1 =2, and z1=3. \n\n3. Vector 2 should have x2=4, y2=5,  and z2=6. \n\n4. Print both vectors to make sure your code is working properly.\n\n\n```python\nV1 = np.array([1,2,3])\nV2 = np.array([4,5,6])\nprint(\"V1: \", V1)\nprint(\"V2: \", V2)\n```\n\n    V1:  [1 2 3]\n    V2:  [4 5 6]\n\n\nIf this is not too familiar, here's a useful link for creating vectors in python\n<https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/user/basics.creation.html>. Alternatively, look up the [introductory slides](https://mhjensen.github.io/Physics321/doc/pub/week2/html/week2.html).\n\nNow let us do some basic mathematics with vectors.\n\nCompute and print the following, and double check with your own paper and pencil calculations:\n\n* 6a (2pt)  Calculate $\\boldsymbol{V}_1-\\boldsymbol{V}_2$.\n\n* 6b (2pt)  Calculate $\\boldsymbol{V}_2-\\boldsymbol{V}_1$.\n\n* 6c (2pt) Calculate the dot product $\\boldsymbol{V}_1\\boldsymbol{V}_2$.\n\n* 6d (2pt) Calculate the cross product $\\boldsymbol{V}_1\\times\\boldsymbol{V}_2$.\n\nHere is some useful explanation on numpy array operations if you feel a bit confused by what is happening,\nsee <https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/overview-basic-numpy-operations>.\n\nThe following code prints the first two exercises\n\n\n```python\nprint(V1-V2)\nprint(V2-V1)\n```\n\n    [-3 -3 -3]\n    [3 3 3]\n\n\nFor the dot product of V1 and V2 below we can use the **dot** function of **numpy** as follows\n\n\n```python\nprint(V1.dot(V2))\n```\n\n    32\n\n\nAs a small challenge try to write your own function for the **dot** product of two vectors.\n\nMatrices can be created in a similar fashion in python.  In this\nlanguage we can work with them through the package numpy (which we\nhave already imported)\n\n\n```python\nM1 = np.matrix([[1,2,3],\n             [4,5,6],\n             [7,8,9]])\nM2 = np.matrix([[1,2],\n             [3,4],\n             [5,6]])\nM3 = np.matrix([[9,8,7],\n             [4,5,6],\n             [7,6,9]])\n```\n\nMatrices can be added in the same way vectors are added in python as shown here\n\n\n```python\nprint(\"M1+M3: \", M1+M3)\n```\n\n    M1+M3:  [[10 10 10]\n     [ 8 10 12]\n     [14 14 18]]\n\n\nWhat happens if we try to do $M1+M2$?\n\nThat's enough vectors and matrices for now. Let's move on to some physics problems! \n\nWe can opt for two different ways of handling the data. The data are\nlisted in the table here and represents the total time Usain Bolt used\nin steps of 10 meters of distance. The label $i$ is just a counter and\nwe start from zero since Python arrays are by default set from\nzero. The variable $t$ is time in seconds and $x$ is the position in\nmeters. You may find it useful to include results at time $t=0$ as well. The position is obviously then $x=0$ m.\n\n<table class=\"dotable\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr><th align=\"center\"> i  </th> <th align=\"center\"> 0  </th> <th align=\"center\"> 1  </th> <th align=\"center\"> 2  </th> <th align=\"center\"> 3  </th> <th align=\"center\"> 4  </th> <th align=\"center\"> 5  </th> <th align=\"center\"> 6  </th> <th align=\"center\"> 7  </th> <th align=\"center\"> 8  </th> <th align=\"center\"> 9  </th> </tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td align=\"center\">   x[m]    </td> <td align=\"center\">   10      </td> <td align=\"center\">   20      </td> <td align=\"center\">   30      </td> <td align=\"center\">   40      </td> <td align=\"center\">   50      </td> <td align=\"center\">   60      </td> <td align=\"center\">   70      </td> <td align=\"center\">   80      </td> <td align=\"center\">   90      </td> <td align=\"center\">   100     </td> </tr>\n<tr><td align=\"center\">   t[s]    </td> <td align=\"center\">   1.85    </td> <td align=\"center\">   2.87    </td> <td align=\"center\">   3.78    </td> <td align=\"center\">   4.65    </td> <td align=\"center\">   5.50    </td> <td align=\"center\">   6.32    </td> <td align=\"center\">   7.14    </td> <td align=\"center\">   7.96    </td> <td align=\"center\">   8.79    </td> <td align=\"center\">   9.69    </td> </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n* 6e (6pt) You can make a file with the above data and read them in and set up two vectors, one for time and one for position. Alternatively, you can just set up these two vectors directly and define two vectors in your Python code.\n\nThe following example code may help here\n\n\n```python\n# we just initialize time and position\nx = np.array([10.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0, 50.0, 60.0, 70.0, 80.0, 90.0, 100.0])\nt = np.array([1.85, 2.87, 3.78, 4.65, 5.50, 6.32, 7.14, 7.96, 8.79, 9.69])\nplt.plot(t,x, color='black')\nplt.xlabel(\"Time t[s]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Position x[m]\")\nplt.title(\"Usain Bolt's world record run\")\nplt.show()\n```\n\n\n    \n![png](hw1_files/hw1_20_0.png)\n    \n\n\n* 6f (6pt) Plot the position as function of time\n\n* 6g (10pt) Compute thereafter the mean velocity for every interval $i$ and the total velocity (from $i=0$ to the given interval $i$) for each interval and plot these two quantities as function of time. Comment your results.\n\n* 6h (10pt) Finally, compute and plot the mean acceleration for each interval and the total acceleration. Again, comment your results. Can you see whether he slowed down during the last meters?\n"

        "# Homework 2 (Due 31 Jan)\n\n**Due January 31 (midnight)**\n\nTotal points: **100**.\n\n**Practicalities about  homeworks and projects**\n\n1. You can work in groups (optimal groups are often 2-3 people) or by yourself. If you work as a group you can hand in one answer only if you wish. **Remember to write your name(s)**!\n2. Homeworks are available approximately ten days before the deadline. You should anticipate this work.\n3. How do I(we)  hand in?  You can hand in the paper and pencil exercises as a **single scanned PDF document**. For this homework this applies to exercises 1-5. Your jupyter notebook file should be converted to a **PDF** file, attached to the same PDF file as for the pencil and paper exercises. All files should be uploaded to Gradescope. \n\n**[Instructions for submitting to Gradescope](../resources/gradescope-submissions.md).**\n\n### Exercise 1 (10 pt), Forces, discussion questions, test your intuition\n\nThese questions expect not only an answer, but an explanation of your reasoning. \n\n*To receive full credit, these answers should include both the underlying physics that explains your answer, but how you feel about that answer (i.e. are you confident? do you like this answer? do it unsettle you? it's ok to feel uncomfortable right now with these ideas; physics intuition is developed and often has to be resolved with our everyday experiences).*\n\n* 1a (2pt) Single force. Can an object affected only by a single force have zero acceleration?\n\n* 1b (2pt) Zero velocity. If you throw a ball vertically it has zero velocity at its maximum point. Does it also have zero acceleration at this point?\n\n* 1c (3pt) Acceleration of gravity. You measure the acceleration of gravity in an elevator moving at a velocity of 9.8m/s downwards. What will you measure?\n\n* 1d (3pt) Air resistance. You throw a ball straight up and measure the velocity as it passes you on its way down. Will the velocity be larger, the same, or smaller if you did the same experiment in vacuum?\n\n### Exercise 2 (10 pt), setting up forces, Newton's second law\n\nUseful material here to read is\n1. Taylor chapters 1.3 and 1.4 and\n\n2. Malthe-S\u00f8renssen chapters 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3\n\nA person jumps from an airplane, falling freely for several seconds before the person pulls the cord of the parachute and the parachute unfolds. \n* 2a (3pt)  Identify the forces acting on the parachuter and draw a free-body diagram of the parachuter before the person has pulled the cord. Include a brief discussion of any assumptions you make, motivate and justify your choices.\n\n* 2b (3pt)  Identify the forces acting on the parachuter and draw a free-body diagram of the parachuter after the person has pulled the cord. Include a brief discussion of any assumptions you make, motivate and justify your choices.\n\n* 2c (4pt)  Sketch the net force acting on the parachuter as a function of time, F(t). Your sketch should be qualitatively correct, indicate the axes, and show clearly which forces are acting on the parachuter before and after the person has pulled the cord. \n\n### Exercise 3 (10 pt), Space shuttle with air resistance\n\nUseful material here to read is: Malthe-S\u00f8renssen chapters 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3\n\nDuring lift-off of the space shuttle the engines provide a force of $35\\times 10^{6}$ N. The mass of the shuttle is approximately\n$2\\times 10^6$ kg.\n\n* 3a (3pt) Draw a free-body diagram of the space shuttle immediately after lift-off.\n\n* 3b (3pt)  Find an expression for the acceleration of the space shuttle immediately after lift-off.\n\nLet us assume that the force from the engines is constant, and that the mass of the\nspace shuttle does not change significantly over the first 20 s.\n* 3c (4pt) Find the velocity and position of the space shuttle after 20 s if you ignore air resistance.\n\n### Exercise 4 (15 pt), Hitting a golf ball\n\nUseful material here to read is\n* Taylor chapters 1.3-1.6 and\n* Malthe-S\u00f8renssen chapter 6.3-6.4 and 7.1-7.3\n\n**Do Taylor exercise 1.35**. The formulae you obtain here will be useful for the numerical exercises below (see exercise 6 below).\n\n*Repeated below consistent with [fair use practices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use)*\n\nA golf ball is hit from ground level with a speed $v_0$  in a direction due east that is at an angle $\\theta$ above the horizontal. \n\n* 4a (5 pt) Neglecting air resistance, use Newton's second law to find the position as a function of time, using the coordinates $x$ measured east, $y$ measured north, and $z$ measured up.\n* 4b (5 pt) Find the time the golf ball is in the air and how far it travels in that time.\n\n**Reflect on the form of your answer.**\n\n* 4c (5 pt) Your answers should depend on $v_0$ and $\\theta$. What can you say about the dependence of the time the golf ball is in the air and the distance it travels on these two variables? How can we believe this functional form of your answer? How can we check it? Propose a check and check that your answer is consistent with this check.\n\n### Exercise 5 (15 pt), ball thrown along a sloped ramp\n\n**Taylor exercise 1.39.** Make sure to draw your setup clearly, show your free-body diagram, and explain any assumptions you make to solve the problem.\n\n*Repeated below consistent with [fair use practices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use)*\n\nA ball is thrown with initial speed $v_0$ up an inclined plane. The plane is inclined at an angle $\\phi$ above the horizontal, and the ball's initial velocity is at an angle $\\theta$ above the plane. Choose axes with $x$ measured up the slope, $y$ normal to the slope, and $z$ across it.\n\n* 5a (5 pt) Write down Newton's second law using these axes and find the ball's position as a function of time. **Make sure to include the FBD and any assumptions you make.**\n* 5b (5 pt) Show that the ball lands a distance \n\n$$R=2v_0^2\\dfrac{\\sin\\theta\\cos\\left(\\theta + \\phi\\right)}{g \\cos^2 \\phi}$$\n\nfrom its launch point. **This is measured up the ramp (i.e., along it).**\n\n* 5c (5 pt) Show that for given $v_0$ and $\\phi$, the maximum range up the inclined plane is:\n\n$$R_{\\text{max}}=\\dfrac{v_0^2}{g(1+\\sin\\phi)}$$\n\n### Exercise 6 (40pt), Numerical elements, moving to more than one dimension\n\n**This exercise should be handed in as a jupyter-notebook** at D2L. Remember to write your name(s). \n\nLast week we:\n1. Analytically mapped 1D motion over some time\n\n2. Gained practice with functions\n\n3. Reviewed vectors and matrices in Python\n\nThis week we will:\n1. Practice using Python syntax and variable manipulation\n\n2. Utilize analytical solutions to create more refined functions\n\n3. Work in two, three or even higher dimensions\n\nThis material will then serve as background for the numerical part of homework 3. The first part is a simple warm-up, with hints and suggestions you can use for the code to write below.\n\n\n```python\n%matplotlib inline\n\n# As usual, here are some useful packages we will be using. Feel free to use more and experiment as you wish.\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom mpl_toolkits import mplot3d\n%matplotlib inline\n```\n\nIn class (the falling baseball example) we used an  analytical expression for the height of a falling ball.\nIn the first homework we used instead the position from experiment (Usain Bolt's 100m record run) and stored this\ninformation with one-dimensional arrays in Python.\n\nLet us get some practice with this. The cell below creates two arrays,\none containing the times to be analyzed and the other containing the $x$\nand $y$ components of the position vector at each point in time.  This is a two-dimensional object. The\nsecond array is initially empty. Then we define  the initial\nposition to be $x=2$ and $y=1$. Take a look at the code and comments\nto get an understanding of what is happening. Feel free to play around with it.\n\n\n```python\ntf = 4 #length of value to be analyzed\ndt = .001 # step sizes\nt = np.arange(0.0,tf,dt) # Creates an evenly spaced time array going from 0 to 3.999, with step sizes .001\np = np.zeros((len(t), 2)) # Creates an empty array of [x,y] arrays (our vectors). Array size is same as the one for time.\np[0] = [2.0,1.0] # This sets the inital position to be x = 2 and y = 1\n```\n\nBelow we are printing specific values of our array to see what is being\nstored where. The first number in the array $r[]$ represents which array\niteration we are looking at, while the number after the  represents\nwhich listed number in the array iteration we are getting back.\n\n\n```python\nprint(p[0]) # Prints the first array\nprint(p[0,:]) # Same as above, these commands are interchangeable\n```\n\n    [2. 1.]\n    [2. 1.]\n\n\n\n```python\nprint(p[3999]) # Prints the 4000th array\n```\n\n    [0. 0.]\n\n\n\n```python\nprint(p[0,0]) # Prints the first value of the first array\n```\n\n    2.0\n\n\n\n```python\nprint(p[0,1]) # Prints the second value of first array\nprint(p[:,0]) # Prints the first value of all the arrays\n```\n\n    1.0\n    [2. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]\n\n\nThen try running this cell. Notice how it gives an error since we did not implement a third dimension into our arrays\n\n\n```python\n#print(p[:,2])\n```\n\nIn the cell below we want to manipulate the arrays.\nIn this example we make each vector's $x$ component valued the same as their respective vector's position in the iteration and the $y$ value will be twice that value, except for  the first vector, which we have already set. \nThat is we have $p[0] = [2,1], p[1] = [1,2], p[2] = [2,4], p[3] = [3,6], ...$\n\nHere we set up an array for $x$ and $y$ values.\n\n\n```python\nfor i in range(1,3999):\n    p[i] = [i,2*i]\n# Checker cell to make sure your code is performing correctly\nc = 0\nfor i in range(0,3999):\n    if i == 0:\n        if p[i,0] != 2.0:\n            c += 1\n        if p[i,1] != 1.0:\n            c += 1\n    else:\n        if p[i,0] != 1.0*i:\n            c += 1\n        if p[i,1] != 2.0*i:\n            c += 1\n\nif c == 0:\n    print(\"Success!\")\nelse:\n    print(\"There is an error in your code\")\n```\n\n    Success!\n\n\nYou could also think of an alternative way of storing the above information. Feel free to explore how to store\nmultidimensional objects. \n\nLast week we studied Usain Bolt's 100m run and in class we studied a falling baseball. We made basic plots of the baseball\nmoving in one dimension. This week we will be working with a three-dimensional variant. This will be useful for our next homeworks and numerical projects. \n\nAssume we have a soccer ball moving in three dimensions with the following trajectory:\n\n$$x(t) = 10t\\cos{45^{\\circ}}$$\n\n$$y(t) = 10t\\sin{45^{\\circ}}$$\n\n$$z(t) = 10t-\\dfrac{9.81}{2}t^2$$\n\nNow let us create a three-dimensional (3D) plot using these equations. In the cell below\nwe write the equations into their respective labels. We fix a final time in the code below.\n\nImportant Concept: Numpy comes with many mathematical packages, some\nof them being the trigonometric functions sine, cosine, tangent. We\nare going to utilize these this week. Additionally, these functions\nwork with radians, so we will also be using a function from Numpy that\nconverts degrees to radians.\n\n\n```python\ntf = 2.04  # The final time to be evaluated\ndt = 0.1  # The time step size\nt = np.arange(0,tf,dt) # The time array\ntheta_deg = 45 # Degrees\ntheta_rad = np.radians(theta_deg) # Converts degrees to their radian counterparts\nx = 10*t*np.cos(theta_rad) # Equation for our x component, utilizing np.cos() and our calculated radians\ny = 10*t*np.sin(theta_rad) # Put the y equation here\nz = 10*t-9.81/2*t**2# Put the z equation here\n```\n\nThen we plot it\n\n\n```python\n## Once you have entered the proper equations in the cell above, run this cell to plot in 3D\nfig = plt.axes(projection='3d')\nfig.set_xlabel('x')\nfig.set_ylabel('y')\nfig.set_zlabel('z')\nfig.scatter(x,y,z)\n```\n\n\n\n\n    <mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.art3d.Path3DCollection at 0x118aa4740>\n\n\n\n* 6a (8pt) How would you express $x(t)$, $y(t)$, $z(t)$ for this problem as a single vector, $\\boldsymbol{r}(t)$?\n\nThen run the code and plot using the array $r$\n\n\n```python\n## Run this code to plot using our r array \n# fig = plt.axes(projection='3d')\n# fig.set_xlabel('x')\n# fig.set_ylabel('y')\n# fig.set_zlabel('z')\n# fig.scatter(r[0],r[1],r[2])\n```\n\n* 6b (8pt) What do you think the benefits and/or disadvantages are from expressing our three equations as a single array/vector? This can be both from a computational and physics stand point. Use the **Numpy** package to also print the maximum $x$, $y$ and $z$ components from $\\boldsymbol{r}$.\n\nComplete Exercise 4 above (Taylor exercise 1.35) before moving further. (Recall that the golf ball was hit due east at an angle $\\theta$ with respect to the horizontal, and the coordinate directions are $x$ measured east, $y$ north, and $z$ vertically up.)\n\n* 6c (8pt) What is the analytical solution for our theoretical golf ball's position $\\boldsymbol{r}(t)$ over time from Exercise 4?  Also what is the formula for the time $t_f$ when the golf ball hits the ground? Use this to develop a program with a function called for example Golfball that utilizes our analytical solutions. This program should take in an initial velocity and the angle $\\theta$ that the golfball was hit with in degrees. It should also produce  a 3D graph of the motion. You need also to find the maximum values for $x$, $y$ and $z$.\n\n* 6d (8pt) Given initial values of $v_i = 90 m/s$, $\\theta = 30^{\\circ}$, what would our maximum x, y and z components be? \n\n* 6e (8pt) Given initial values of $v_i = 45 m/s$, $\\theta = 45^{\\circ}$, what would our maximum x, y and z components be?\n"

The relevant reading background is\n1. chapter 2 of Taylor (there are many good examples there) and\n\n2. chapters 5-7 of Malthe-S\u00f8renssen.\n\nIn both textbooks there are many nice worked out\nexamples. Malthe-S\u00f8renssen's text contains also several coding\nexamples you may find useful.\n\nThere are several pedagogical aims we have in mind with these exercises:\n1. Get practice in setting up and analyzing a physical problem, finding the forces and the relevant equations to solve;\n\n2. Analyze the results and ask yourself whether they make sense or not;\n\n3. Finding analytical solutions to problems if possible and compare these with numerical results. This teaches us also how to understand errors in numerical calculations;\n\n4. Being able to solve (in mechanics these are the most common types of equations) numerically ordinary differential equations and compare the solutions where possible with analytical solutions;\n\n5. Getting used to studying physical problems using all possible tools, from paper and pencil to numerical solutions;\n\n6. Then analyze the results and ask yourself whether they make sense or not.\n\nThe above steps outline important elements of our understanding of the\nscientific method. Furthermore, there are also explicit coding skills\nwe aim at such as setting up arrays, solving differential equations\nnumerically and plotting your results.  Coding practice is also an\nimportant aspect. The more we practice the better we get (hopefully).\nFrom a numerical mathematics point of view, we will solve the differential\nequations using Euler's method (forward Euler).\n\nThe code we will develop can be reused as a basis for coming homeworks. We can\nalso extend the numerical solver we write here to include other methods (later) like\nthe modified Euler method (Euler-Cromer, midpoint Euler) and more\nadvanced methods like the family of Runge-Kutta methods and the Velocity-Verlet method.\n\nAt the end of this course, we will thus have developed a larger code\n(or set of codes) which will allow us to study different numerical\nmethods (integration and differential equations) as well as being able\nto study different physical systems. Combined with analytical skills,\nthe hope is that this can allow us to explore interesting and\nrealistic physics problems. By doing so, the hope is that can lead to\ndeeper insights about the laws of motion which govern a system.\n\nAnd hopefully you can reuse many of the above solvers in other courses (our ideal).\n\n### Practicalities about  homeworks and projects\n\n1. You can work in groups (optimal groups are often 2-3 people) or by yourself. If you work as a group you can hand in one answer only if you wish. **Remember to write your name(s)**!\n\n2. Homeworks are available ten days  before the deadline. \n\n3. How do I(we)  hand in?  You can hand in the paper and pencil exercises as a **single scanned PDF document**. For this homework this applies to exercises 1-5. Your jupyter notebook file should be converted to a **PDF** file, attached to the same PDF file as for the pencil and paper exercises. All files should be uploaded to Gradescope. \n\n**[Instructions for submitting to Gradescope](../resources/gradescope-submissions.md).**\n\n## Exercise 1 (20 pt), Electron moving into an electric field\n\nAn electron is sent through a varying electrical\nfield. Initially, the electron is moving in the $x$-direction with a velocity\n$v_x = 100$ m/s. The electron enters the field when it passes the origin. The field\nvaries with time, causing an acceleration of the electron that varies in time\n\n$$\n\\vec{a}(t)=\\left(-20\\mathrm{m/s}^2-10\\mathrm{m/s}^3t\\right) \\vec{e}_y\n$$\n\n* 1a (4pt) Find the velocity as a function of time for the electron.\n\n* 1b (4pt)  Find the position as a function of time for the electron.\n\nThe field is only acting inside a box of length $L = 2m$.\n* 1c (4pt)  For how long time is the electron inside the field?\n\n* 1d (4pt)  What is the displacement in the $y$-direction when the electron leaves the box. (We call this the deflection of the electron).\n\n* 1e (4pt)  Find the angle the velocity vector forms with the horizontal axis as the electron leaves the box.\n\n## Exercise 2 (10 pt), Drag force\n\nWe can observe that the models for linear and quadratic drag forces are given by:\n\n$$f_{lin} = 3\\pi \\eta D v \\qquad f_{quad} = \\kappa \\rho A v^2$$\n\nwhere $D$ is the \"length scale\" of the object (e.g., the diameter of the sphere), $\\eta$ is the viscosity of the fluid, $\\rho$ is the density of the fluid, $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the object, and $\\kappa$ is a constant of order unity (larger for flat and blunt bodies; smaller for streamlined bodies).\n\n* 2a (5pt) The Reynolds number is defined as $Re = \\rho v D / \\eta$. What is the physical meaning of this number? For a spherical object, show that the ratio of the quadratic drag force to the linear drag force is given by $f_{quad}/f_{lin} = Re/48$. Use this to explain the physical meaning of the Reynolds number. **Note: you may assume that $\\kappa = 0.25$ for a sphere.**\n* 2b (2pt) Explain a situation where there would be a low Reynolds number. What about a high Reynolds number? Estimate the Reynolds number for a falling rain drop, a parachutist, a car, and a plane.\n* 2c (3pt) Find another [dimensionless number from fluid mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_numbers_in_fluid_mechanics) and explain its physical meaning. Make sure you consider high and low values of the number you find.\n\n## Exercise 3 (10 pt), Falling object\n\nWe have shown that an object that is dropped from rest and experiences linear drag force will reach a terminal velocity and do so exponentially:\n\n$$v_y(t) = v_{ter}(1-e^{-t/\\tau}).$$\n\n* 3a (4pt) At first, the object will be moving slowly. Show that we can approximate this expression in that interval. We should find that $v_y = gt$ -- the standard result for free fall in vacuum. Demonstrate this. \n* 3b (3pt) What is the next term, $O(t^2)$, in the expansion? What is the physical meaning of this term?\n* 3c (4pt) The position of the object is given by: $y(t) = v_{ter}t + (v_{y0}-v_{ter})\\tau(1-e^{-t/\\tau})$. Show that this reduces to the standard result $y = \\frac{1}{2}gt^2$ when $v_{y0} = 0$. What is the small parameter in your expansions in all cases?\n\n## Exercise 4 (10 pt), and now a theoretical exercise\n\nFinding and exploring equations of motion is the central enterprise of classical mechanics. You will encounter (and derive) many equations you have not seen before, and you will need to explain them. Consider a hypothetical one-dimensional system where a mass $m$ has a speed of $v_0$ and coasts along the x-axis. The surrounding medium produces a drag force that is modeled using:\n\n$$F(v) = -c v^{3/2}.$$\n\nWhen the force is a pure function of velocity, using the technique called separation of variables on Newton's 2nd Law, we can find the velocity as a function of time:\n\nWe can separate variables and write:\n\n$$F(v) = m a = m \\dfrac{dv}{dt}$$\n\nDivide both sides by $F(v)$ and multiply both sides by $dt$:\n\n$$dt = \\dfrac{m}{F(v)}dv$$\n\nAnd then, given starting (initial) conditions, we integrate both sides to find an expression for $t$ as a function of $v$.\n\n$$t = m \\int_{v_0}^v \\dfrac{dv'}{F(v')}$$\n\n* 4a (4pt) For the given force above, write the equation of motion in a form: $\\dfrac{m dv}{F(v)} = dt$. Integrate both sides to find an expression for the velocity $v$ as a function of $t$ ($v(t)$ not $t(v)$). \n* 4b (2pt) Check your answer by looking at the limits of its behavior. Does it agree with your intuition?\n* 4c (2pt) Sketch the expression and explain what the motion of the object looks like by interpreting this expression and your sketch.\n* 4d (2pt) Will the object ever come to rest?  \n\n## Exercise 5 (10 pt), back to a falling ball and preparing for the numerical exercise\n\n**Useful material: Malthe-S\u00f8renssen chapter 7.5 and Taylor chapter 2.4.**\n\nIn this example we study the motion of an object subject to a constant force and a velocity dependent\nforce. We will reuse the code we develop here in homework 4 for a position-dependent force.\n\nHere we limit ourselves to a ball that is thrown from a height $h$\nabove the ground with an initial velocity\n$\\vec{v}_0$ at time $t=t_0$. We assume the air resistance is proportional to the square velocity. Together with the gravitational force these are the forces acting on our system.\n\n```{note}\nDue to the specific velocity dependence, we cannot find an analytical solution for motion in the $x$ and $y$ directions, see the discussion in Taylor after eq. (2.61).\n```\n\nIn order to find an analytical solution we need to assume that the object is falling in the $y$-direction (negative direction) only. \n\nThe position of the ball as function of time is  $\\vec{r}(t)$ where $t$ is time.\n The position is measured with respect to a coordinate system with origin at the floor.\n\nWe assume we have an initial position $\\vec{r}(t_0)=h\\vec{e}_y$ and an initial velocity $\\vec{v}_0=v_{x,0}\\vec{e}_x+v_{y,0}\\vec{e}_y$.\n\nIn this exercise we assume the system is influenced by the gravitational force\n\n$$\n\\vec{F}_{grav}=-mg\\vec{e}_y\n$$\n\nand an air resistance given by a square law\n\n$$\n\\vec{F}_{drag} = -Dv\\vec{v}.\n$$\n\nThe analytical expressions for velocity and position as functions of\ntime will be used to compare with the numerical results in exercise 6.\n\n* 5a (3pt) Identify the forces acting on the ball and set up a diagram with the forces acting on the ball. Find the equation of motion for the falling ball. **Do not limit to 1D yet!**\n\n* 5b (4pt) Assume now that the object is falling only in the $y$-direction (negative direction). Integrate the equation of motion from an initial time $t_0$ to a final time $t$ and find the velocity. Assume it is dropped from rest to simplify the mathematics.  In Taylor equations (2.52) to (2.58) you will find a very good discussion of this.\n\n* 5c (3pt) Find thereafter the position as function of time starting with an initial time $t_0$. Find the time it takes to hit the floor.  Here you will find it convenient to set the initial velocity in the $y$-direction to zero. Taylor equations (2.52)-(2.58) should contain all relevant information for solving this part as well.\n\nWe will use the above analytical results in our numerical calculations in exercise 6. The analytical solution in the $y$-direction only will serve as a test for our numerical solution. **We don't often know the solutions to our problems exactly, so we have to check them against things we do know.**\n\n## Exercise 6 (40pt), Numerical elements, solving exercise 5 numerically\n\n**This exercise should be handed in as a jupyter-notebook** at D2L. Remember to write your name(s). \n\nLast week we:\n1. Gained more practice with plotting in Python\n\n2. Became familiar with arrays and representing vectors with such objects\n\nThis week we will:\n1. Learn and utilize Euler's Method to find the position and the velocity\n\n2. Compare analytical and computational solutions \n\n3. Add additional forces to our model\n\n\n```python\n%matplotlib inline\n\n# let's start by importing useful packages we are familiar with\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n```\n\nWe will choose the following values\n1. mass $m=0.2$ kg\n\n2. accelleration (gravity) $g=9.81$ m/s$^{2}$.\n\n3. initial position is the height $h=2$ m\n\n4. initial velocities $v_{x,0}=v_{y,0}=10$ m/s\n\nCan you find a reasonable value for the drag coefficient $D$?\nYou need also to define an initial time and \nthe step size $\\Delta t$. We can define the step size $\\Delta t$ as the difference between any\ntwo neighboring values in time (time steps) that we analyze within\nsome range. It can be determined by dividing the interval we are\nanalyzing, which in our case is time $t_{\\mathrm{final}}-t_0$, by the number of steps we\nare taking $(N)$. This gives us a step size $\\Delta t = \\dfrac{t_{\\mathrm{final}}-t_0}{N}$.\n\nWith these preliminaries we are now ready to plot our results from exercise 5.\n\n* 6a (10pt) Set up arrays for time, velocity, acceleration and positions for the results from exercise 5. Define an initial and final time. Choose the final time to be the time when the ball hits the ground for the first time. Make a plot of the position and velocity as functions of time.  Here you could set the initial velocity in the $y$-direction to zero and use the result from exercise 5. Else you need to try different initial times using the result from exercise 5 as a starting guess.  It is not critical if you don't reach the ground when the initial velocity in the $y$-direction is not zero.\n\nWe move now to the numerical solution of the differential equations as discussed in the [lecture notes](https://mhjensen.github.io/Physics321/doc/pub/motion/html/motion.html) or Malthe-S\u00f8renssen chapter 7.5.\nLet us remind ourselves about  Euler's Method.\n\nSuppose we know $f(t)$ and its derivative $f'(t)$. To find $f(t+\\Delta t)$ at the next step, $t+\\Delta t$,\nwe can consider the Taylor expansion:\n\n$f(t+\\Delta t) = f(t) + \\dfrac{(\\Delta t)f'(t)}{1!} + \\dfrac{(\\Delta t)^2f''(t)}{2!} + ...$\n\nIf we ignore the $f''$ term and higher derivatives, we obtain\n\n$f(t+\\Delta t) \\approx f(t) + (\\Delta t)f'(t)$.\n\nThis approximation is the basis of Euler's method, and the Taylor\nexpansion suggests that it will have errors of $O(\\Delta t^2)$.  Thus, one\nwould expect it to work better, the smaller the step size $h$ that you\nuse. In our case the step size is $\\Delta t$. \n\nIn setting up our code we need to\n\n1. Define and obtain all initial values, constants, and time to be analyzed with step sizes as done above (you can use the same values)\n\n2. Calculate the velocity using $v_{i+1} = v_{i} + (\\Delta t)*a_{i}$\n\n3. Calculate the position using $pos_{i+1} = r_{i} + (\\Delta t)*v_{i}$\n\n4. Calculate the new acceleration $a_{i+1}$.\n\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for all time steps within a loop.\n\n* 6b (20 pt) Write a code which implements Euler's method and compute numerically and plot the position and velocity as functions of time for various values of $\\Delta t$. Comment your results.\n\n* 6c (10pt) Compare your numerically obtained positions and velocities with the analytical results from exercise 5. In order to do this, you need to take out the motion in the $x$-direction. Comment again your results.\n\n### Integrating Classwork With Research\n\nThis opportunity will allow you to earn up to 5 extra credit points on a Homework per week. These points can push you above 100% or help make up for missed exercises.\nIn order to earn all points you must:\n\n1.

We also have a preparation exercise for the upcoming midterms and final project.\n\nThe relevant reading background is\n1. chapters 3, 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 of Taylor (there are many good examples there) and\n\n2. chapters 10-13 of Malthe-S\u00f8renssen.\n\n3. for the numerical exercise see Malthe-S\u00f8renssen section 7.5\n\nIn both textbooks there are many nice worked out examples. Malthe-S\u00f8renssen's text contains also several coding examples you may find useful. \n\nThe numerical homework focuses on another motion problem where you can\nuse the code you developed in homework 3, almost entirely. Please take\na look at the posted solution (jupyter-notebook) for homework 3 (**POSTED AFTER HW3 DUE**). You\nneed only to change the forces at play. The numerical problem this time is based\non your code from homework 3 and we will try to make the motion of a falling object in two dimensions more realistic by allowing to bounce up again due to a normal force from the floor.\n\n### Practicalities about  homeworks and projects\n\n1. You can work in groups (optimal groups are often 2-3 people) or by yourself. If you work as a group you can hand in one answer only if you wish. **Remember to write your name(s)**!\n\n2. Homeworks are available ten days  before the deadline. \n\n3. How do I(we)  hand in?  You can hand in the paper and pencil exercises as a **single scanned PDF document**. For this homework this applies to exercises 1-5. Your jupyter notebook file should be converted to a **PDF** file, attached to the same PDF file as for the pencil and paper exercises. All files should be uploaded to Gradescope. \n\n**[Instructions for submitting to Gradescope](../resources/gradescope-submissions.md).**\n\n### Exercise 1 (15 pts), Is this a conservative force?\n\nConsider a particle of mass $m$ moving in two dimensions. The particle moves from $(0,0)$ to $(1,1)$ along three different paths, $a$, $b$ and $c$ as shown in the figure below. \n\n![Paths](../images/activities/paths.png)\n\nIn this space, the particle experiences a force:\n\n$$\\vec{F} = \\langle x^2, 2xy \\rangle = x^2\\hat{i} + 2xy \\hat{j}$$\n\n* 1a (3pt) Calculate the work done by the along path $a$, which is a straight line from $(0,0)$ to $(1,0)$, and then to $(1,1)$. *Break the path into two segments and calculate the work done along each segment separately.*\n* 1b (3pt) Calculate the work done by the force along path $b$, which follows the function $y = x^2$ from $(0,0)$ to $(1,1)$.\n* 1c (4pt) Calculate the work done by the force along path $c$, which is given parametrically by $x = t^3$ and $y = t^2$ from $(0,0)$ to $(1,1)$.\n* 1d (5pt) Is this force conservative? Explain your answer in at least two ways.\n\n### Exercise 2 (10 pt), Sliding puck\n\nA small puck rests on a fixed sphere of radius $R$. The puck is given a tiny nudge and it slides down the sphere. Using conservation of energy, we can determine the point at which the puck leaves the sphere.\n\n* 2a (3pt) Setup the problem with a sketch. Explain the setup and include any assumptions that you need to make in order to solve the problem analytically. Identify the height as a function of the polar angle, $h(\\theta)$. What is the maximum possible angle $\\theta$ that the puck could reach before falling off? Why?\n* 2b (2pt) Use conservation of energy to find the speed of the puck as a function of it's height. Your answer should be in terms of the polar angle, $\\theta$.\n* 2c (3pt) Use Newton's Second Law to find the normal force acting on the puck as a function of it's height. Your answer should be in terms of the polar angle, $\\theta$. What is the condition for the puck to leave the sphere?\n* 2d (2pt) At what angle and height does the puck leave the sphere? \n\n### Exercise 3 (10pt), Example of potential\n\nConsider a particle of mass $m$ moving according to the potential:\n\n$$\nV(x,y,z)=A\\exp\\left\\{-\\frac{x^2+z^2}{2a^2}\\right\\}.\n$$\n\nWe can think of this potential as the energy landscape of a particle in three dimensions. That is, you can imagine a particle moving around this potential like a ball rolling around a landscape. That analogy is not perfect, but it is a good way to help us think about stability and equilibrium.\n\n* 3a (2pt) Plot this potential or sketch a plot of it. You can use perspective plots, contour plots or any other plot you find useful.\n* 3b (2pt) What are some feature you notice with this potential? What happens when you change $A$ and $a$?\n* 3c (2pt) Imagine a particle moving in this potential, what are some expected trajectories?\n* 3d (2pt) Do there appear to be any equilibrium points? If so, are they stable or unstable?\n* 3a (2pt) Is the resulting force conservative? Why? \n\n### Exercise 4 (15pt), forces  and potentials\n\nA particle of mass $m$ has velocity $v=\\alpha/x$, where $x$ is its displacement.\n\n* 5a (5pt) Find the force $F(x)$ responsible for the motion.\n\nA particle is thereafter under the influence of a force $F=-kx+kx^3/\\alpha^2$, where $k$ and $\\alpha$ are constants and $k$ is positive.\n\n* 5b (5pt) Determine the potential $U(x)$  and discuss the motion. It can be convenient here to make a sketch/plot of the potential as function of $x$.\n\n* 5c (5pt)  What happens when the energy of the particle is $E=(1/4)k\\alpha^2$? Hint: what is the maximum value of the potential energy?\n\n### Exercise 5 (10pt), Midterms and Final Project Preparation\n\nYour final project will be a [computational essay](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12697) of your own design. My colleague, [Tor Ole Odden](https://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/english/people/aca/toroo/), and I have borrowed this idea from a proposal by [Stephen Wolfram](https://www.stephenwolfram.com/). In his [original post](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2017/11/what-is-a-computational-essay), Wolfram talks about the importance of the computational medium as a way of communicating science. \n\nTor, myself, and others have started building this idea into a [theory of computational learning in physics](https://journals.aps.org/prper/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.15.020152), using computational essays to [argue for the importance of computing in physics](https://www-nature-com.proxy2.cl.msu.edu/articles/s41567-023-02371-2), building [the theory out](https://pubs-aip-org.proxy2.cl.msu.edu/books/monograph/148/chapter/64396056/Physics-Computational-Literacy-What-Why-and-How), and trying to identify the ways making course work and materials to promote [agency, creativity, and ownership](https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.proxy2.cl.msu.edu/doi/full/10.1002/tea.21821).\n\nIn this homework question, we are going to start building your plan for your computational essay. I ask that you complete this particular homework problem by yourself because it is important for each of you to do this planning.\n\nTo get started, you should read the following articles; they are not very long:\n\n1. Wolfram's [What is a Computational Essay?](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2017/11/what-is-a-computational-essay)\n2. Tor and my short paper: [Computational Essays: An Avenue for Scientific Creativity in Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12697)\n3. Wolfram's [Steps to Writing a Computational Essay](https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/Expositions/Published/ComputationalEssayGuidelines)\n\nYou are, of course, welcome to read more, but these are the three that I would like you to read.\n\n* 5a (3pt) Write a summary of your readings. What did you learn? What was important? What did you find interesting? What questions do you still have? Full credit will be given for a summary that is at least 250 words long.\n\nComputational essays are a new way to communicate your science. It might be a good idea to look at some examples. Review the [University of Oslo's Computational Essay Showroom](https://uio-ccse.github.io/computational-essay-showroom). \n\n* 5b (3pt) Find at least one computational essay in the [showroom](https://uio-ccse.github.io/computational-essay-showroom) that you find interesting. Write a summary of the computational essay. What did you like? What did you not like? What was interesting about it? What questions do you still have? Full credit will be given for a summary that is at least 250 words long.\n\nThese essays were made by students who were taking a course at the University of Oslo. The essays are not meant to be perfect, they are meant to be representative of the work that students can do.\n\n* 5c (3pt) Evaluate the computational essay based on your readings in 5a. How well does the computational essay follow the concept of physics computational literacy, or the guidelines for a good essay? What are the strengths and weaknesses of the computational essay? Full credit will be given for a summary that is at least 250 words long.\n\nNow, let's move to your future plans. \n\n* 5d (1pt) Write a short paragraph about the things you are interested in studying for your computational essay. This can be a very short paragraph, but it should include at least one image or plot that you find interesting. This can be starting from the homework, the samples in the showroom, or something else entirely.\n\n### Exercise 6 (40pt), Bouncing object\n\nThis exercise builds on the code you wrote for solving homework 3.\nWe recommend strongly that you study the text of Malthe-S\u00f8renssen, section 7.5.\n\nIn homework 3 we introduced gravity and air resistance and studied their\neffects via a constant acceleration due to gravity and the force\narising from air resistance. But what happens when the ball hits the\nfloor? What if we would like to simulate the normal force from the\nfloor acting on the ball?  This exercise shows how we can include more\ncomplicated forces with no pain! And the force we include here is an\nexample of a case where analytical solutions may either be difficult\nto find or we cannot find an analytical solution at all.\n\nWe need then to include a force model for the normal force from the\nfloor on the ball. The simplest approach to such a system is to\nintroduce a contact force model represented by a spring model.  We\nmodel the interaction between the floor and the ball as a single\nspring. But the normal force is zero when there is no contact. Here we\ndefine a simple model that allows us to include such effects in our\nmodels.\n\nThe normal force from the floor on the ball is represented by a spring force. This\nis a strong simplification of the actual deformation process occurring at the contact\nbetween the ball and the floor due to the deformation of both the ball and the floor.\n\nThe deformed region corresponds roughly to the region of **overlap** between the\nball and the floor. The depth of this region is $\\Delta y = R-y(t)$, where $R$\nis the radius of the ball. This is supposed to represent the compression of the spring.\nOur model for the normal force acting on the ball is then\n\n$$\n\\vec{N} = -k (R-y(t)) \\vec{e}_y.\n$$\n\nThe normal force must act upward when $y < R$,\nhence the sign must be negative.\nHowever, we must also ensure that the normal force only acts when the ball is in\ncontact with the floor, otherwise the normal force is zero. The full formation of the\nnormal force is therefore\n\n$$\n\\vec{N} = -k (R-y(t)) \\vec{e}_y,\n$$\n\nwhen $y(t) < R$ and zero when $y(t) \\ge R$.\nIn the numerical calculations you can choose $R=0.1$ m and the spring constant $k=1000$ N/m.\n\n* 6a (10pt) Identify the forces acting on the ball and set up a diagram with the forces acting on the ball. Find the acceleration of the falling ball now with the normal force as well.\n\n* 6b (30pt) Choose a large enough final time so you can study the ball bouncing up and down several times. Add the normal force and compute the height of the ball as function of time with and without air resistance. Comment your results.\n\n### Integrating Classwork With Research\n\nThis opportunity will allow you to earn up to 5 extra credit points on a Homework per week. These points can push you above 100% or help make up for missed exercises.\nIn order to earn all points you must:\n\n1. Attend an MSU research talk (recommended research oriented Clubs is  provided below)\n\n2. Summarize the talk using at least 150 words\n\n3.

It is constrained to move in the $x$ direction only and there is no friction present. With the equilibrium position as $x=0$, then the potential energy is $U(x)=\\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\nWe give the oscillator a little kick at $t=0$ and let it go. It reaches a maximum distance of $A$ from the equilibrium position.\n\n* 1a (2pt) Write down the conservation of energy equation and find the velocity as a function of position (i.e., find $\\dot{x}(x)$).\n\n\n* 1b (4pt) Construct the integral for the time it takes for the oscillator from $x=0$ to any position $x$.\n\n\n* 1c (4pt) Use the integral to find $x(t)$ and show that the period of the oscillator is $T=2\\pi\\sqrt{m/k}$.\n\n\n### Exercise 2 (10pt), Kid's toy and stable equilibrium\n\nA toy is made from a cylinder mounted on a hemisphere as shown in the figure below. The hemisphere has a radius of $R$ and the center of mass of the whole toy is $h$ above the ground.\n\n![toy](../images/activities/5.2-kid_toy.png)\n\n* 2a (2pt) Find the height of the center of mass of the toy as a function of the angle $\\theta$, measured from the vertical.\n\n\n\n* 2b (3pt) Use this to find the gravitational potential energy $U(\\theta)$. Show in a figure how the potential energy varies with $\\theta$. Note that $h/R$ becomes an important parameter. For different choices of $h/R$ do the equilibrium points change? How?\n\n* 2c (5pt) For which values of $R$ and $h$ is the toy in stable equilibrium so that it does not fall over? Does it fit with your graphical analysis? Why does this make sense to you? Or how would you explain it to a friend?\n\n\n\n### Exercise 3 (15pt), \"Generic\" 1D motion\n\nWe will eventually learn how to solve for equations of motion for generalized coordinates. That work requires us to think about the forces and constraints on a system. Here we will consider a particle moving along a curved path to begin to think about how to describe the motion of a particle in a more general way.\n\n![curved-path](../images/activities/5.3-curved_path.png)\n\nA bead follows the curved path above, you can imagine it is a wire or a track, and the bead is constrained to move along the path. The bead's position is described by its distance along the path, $s$ as measured from the origin $O$. The $\\hat{s}$ direction is always along the path - that is, it's always tangent to the wire.\n\n* 3a (3pt) Let's start by writing the velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ in terms of its Cartesian components (e.g., $dx/dt$) and find it's magnitude ($v$). How does this approach seem given the shape of the wire? Do you think we have chosen a good set of coordinates?\n\n* 3b (4pt) Instead, consider the coordinate system $\\langle \\hat{s}, \\hat{s}_{\\perp}\\rangle$. That is the the direction along the path and the direction perpendicular to it (assume we are solving this in a plane for the moment). Use this coordinate system to show that bead's speed is given by $v=\\dot{s}$, that is there is no dependence of the speed on the $\\hat{s}_{\\perp}$ component of $\\vec{v}$. How might this be a better choice?\n\n\n* 3c (4pt) Still using this coordinate system, prove that the tangential component of the net force ($F_{||}$, \"parallel\" to the motion) on the bead is $m\\ddot{s}$. \n\nThere is a force due to the wire ($\\mathbf{F}_w$) that ensures the bead stays on the path. It is not in the direction of the path (i.e., friction), only perpendicular to the wire. Assume all other forces are conservative (i.e., can be derived from a generic potential $-\\nabla U$). \n\n* 3d (4pt) Show that the tangential component of the net force due to the wire is $-\\frac{dU}{ds}$.\n\nThis 1D concept extends to multiple dimensions and can help us understand the Lagrangian method of solving for the equations of motion.\n\n```{admonition} Projection of a gradient\n:class: info\n\nWe can calculate the projection for a generic potential in a particular Cartesian direction. \n\n$$\\nabla U(\\vec{r}) \\cdot \\hat{x} = \\langle \\dfrac{dU(\\vec{r})}{dx}, \\dfrac{dU(\\vec{r})}{dy}, \\dfrac{dU(\\vec{r})}{dz} \\rangle \\cdot \\langle 1,0,0 \\rangle = \\dfrac{dU(\\vec{r})}{dx}$$\n\nUltimately, the projection is the what the potential changes with respect to the projection direction.\n```\n\n### Exercise 4 (15pt), Another 1-D conservative system; baby bifurcations\n\nThe apparatus below is a massless wheel of radius $R$ that is mounted to a frictionless axle. A small, dense piece of clay with mass $M$ is glued to edge of the wheel as shown. Another mass $m$ hangs from a massless string that is wrapped around the wheel. We can assume the string is inextensible and does not slip, and the system is in a uniform gravitational field.\n\n![apparatus](../images/activities/5.4-apparatus.png)\n\nWe can show that this complicated system is still one-dimensional (at least in space) and then we can see the effects of parameters like $m/M$.\n\n* 4a (3pt) In terms of the rotation angle $\\phi$ of the wheel, write down the total potential energy $U(\\phi)$ of the system of both masses. Take note of any constraints that you use to write this as a 1D problem. When working this kind of problem, every object-Earth pair has gravitational potential energy and we must have the same zero of potential energy for every pair.\n\n* 4b (2pt) Use this potential energy to find  values of $m$ and $M$ for which there are \"fixed points\", \"critical points\", or what we sometimes call \"equilibrium points\". The language we use comes from different fields, but the concept is the same. What is the condition for the existence of any critical points?\n\n* 4c (3pt) Describe the fixed points, determine their stability, and explain why they make sense in terms of the expected motion.\n\n* 4d (5pt) Plot the potential energy for two different values of $m/M$ and explain the differences in the potential energy graphs. Consider cases when you observe very different motion. Think about an initial condition where the mass $m$ is at rest and the wheel is at rest. What happens when you release the mass $m$ for your two cases?\n\n* 4e (2pt) Determine the value of $m/M$ for which the system begins to exhibit oscillations (if released from $\\phi=0$). \n\nThe value of $m/M$ is a dimensionless quantity that characterizes the system. In a dynamical system, we think of it as a parameter that can change the qualitative behavior of the system. Such parameters can lead us to [bifurcations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifurcation_theory), [phase transitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_transition), and other interesting (often non-equilibrium) phenomena.\n\n### Exercise 5 (20 pt), Phase Diagrams\n\nOne of the most useful tools we can learn from classical mechanics is the phase diagram. For us, it is the plot of the position and velocity of a particle in a 1D system, but the concept can be extended to higher dimensions and to other systems. The phase diagram can tell us about the stability of fixed points, the period of oscillations, and the qualitative behavior of the system. \n\nIn this exercise, we will consider a particle in a potential $U(x)$ and we will plot the phase diagrams using both `quiver` and `streamplot` in `matplotlib`. The purpose of this exercise is to learn how to plot phase diagrams and to interpret the results.\n\nWe start with a little code for plotting the phase diagram of the simple harmonic oscillator. The code is written in a way that you can easily modify it to plot the phase diagram of other systems. The key point is to make sure that the `quiver` or `streamplot` function is called with the correct arguments. \n\n\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom math import *\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\n%matplotlib inline\nplt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8-colorblind')\n```\n\n\n```python\ndef SHO(X,V):\n    \n    # For a simple harmonic oscillator, x' = v, and v' = -x.\n    dX = V\n    dV = -X\n    \n    return dX, dV\n\ndef generate_phase_space(x_lim, v_lim, grid_size):\n\n    x = np.linspace(x_lim[0], x_lim[1], grid_size)\n    v = np.linspace(v_lim[0], v_lim[1], grid_size)\n    \n    X, V = np.meshgrid(x, v)\n    \n    dX, dV = SHO(X, V)\n    \n    return X, V, dX, dV\n\n# Generate phase space\nx_lim = (-5, 5)\nv_lim = (-5, 5)\ngrid_size = 20\nX, V, dX, dV = generate_phase_space(x_lim, v_lim, grid_size)\n```\n\n\n```python\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(8, 10))  # Two rows, one column\n    \n# Quiver plot on the first subplot\naxs[0].quiver(X, V, dX, dV, color='C0')\naxs[0].set_title('Quiver Plot of SHO Phase Diagram')\naxs[0].set_xlabel(r'$x$')\naxs[0].set_ylabel(r'$\\dot{x}$')\n\n# Stream plot on the second subplot\naxs[1].streamplot(X, V, dX, dV, color='C1')\naxs[1].set_title('Stream Plot of SHO Phase Diagram')\naxs[1].set_xlabel(r'$x$')\naxs[1].set_ylabel(r'$\\dot{x}$');\n```\n\n\n    \n![png](hw5_files/hw5_20_0.png)\n    \n\n\n* 5a (2pt) Explain how the code works to produce the phase diagram. The key part is explaining what the function `SHO` does and how that relates to the `quiver` and `streamplot` calls. What does `np.meshgrid` do and why is it used?\n\nWe have discussed the physical pendulum in class where the potential energy is given by:\n\n$$U(\\theta)=mgl(1-\\cos\\theta)$$\n\n* 5b (4pt) Modify the code to produce the phase diagram for the physical pendulum. You can choose mass and length. Make sure to explore the diagram outside of the small angle approximation. What new features do you observe in the phase diagram? What motion are they associated with?\n\n\n\nNow we have a code that we can use to plot the phase diagram of any 1D system. We will use it to explore the damped harmonic oscillator and the damped physical pendulum. Here we write the equations of motion as the system is still 1-D, but the forces are not derived from a potential.\n\nThe damped harmonic oscillator has the equation of motion:\n$$\\ddot{x}=-\\frac{k}{m}x-\\frac{b}{m}\\dot{x}$$\n\n* 5c (5pt) Modify the code to produce the phase diagram for the damped harmonic oscillator. You can choose $k/m$ and $b/m$, but might want to explore the values. What features do you observe in the phase diagram? What motion are they associated with?\n\nThe damped physical pendulum has the equation of motion:\n$$\\ddot{\\theta}=-\\frac{g}{l}\\sin\\theta-\\frac{b}{ml}\\dot{\\theta}$$\n\n* 5d (5pt) Modify the code again to produce the phase diagram for the damped physical pendulum. You can choose $b/ml$, but might want to explore the values. How does this motion compare to the motion of the damped harmonic oscillator? \n\n* 5e (4pt) Return to the simple harmonic oscillator. Show using conservation of energy the phase diagram is a series of ellipses in $(x,v)$ space. Plot these ellipses on top of a phase diagram for the simple harmonic oscillator to illustrate how the phase diagram explains the total energy of the system.\n\n### Exercise 6 (30pt), Numerical integration techniques and oscillations\n\nWe've discussed the Euler method and made use of it in the prior homeworks. However, the Euler method is not the most accurate method for solving ODEs. It has a real issue with energy conservation, which is a problem for conservative systems. Here we will explore the Euler-Cromer method and the Runge-Kutta methods for the simple harmonic oscillator. You will then apply these same methods to the various oscillators in Exercise 5.\n\nBelow we have written a code to solve the ODE:\n\n$$\\ddot{x}=-\\omega^2 x$$\n\nwhere the initial position is 1 and the initial velocity is 0. The time step is set by the number of integration steps, $N$. We wrote a function called `euler` that will then solve the ODE using the Euler method. There's a second function called `euler_cromer` that uses the Euler-Cromer method.\n\n\n```python\nomega = 1  # Angular frequency\nx0 = 1  # Initial position\nv0 = 0  # Initial velocity\nt0 = 0  # Start time\ntf = 100  # End time\nN = 10000  # Number of time steps\ndt = (tf-t0)/N  # Time step\n\n```\n\n\n```python\ndef euler(omega, x0, v0, t0, tf, dt):\n    t = np.arange(t0, tf, dt)\n    x = np.zeros(t.shape)\n    v = np.zeros(t.shape)\n    x[0], v[0] = x0, v0\n\n    for i in range(1, len(t)):\n        x[i] = x[i-1] + dt * v[i-1]\n        v[i] = v[i-1] - dt * omega**2 * x[i-1]\n\n    return t, x, v\n\ndef euler_cromer(omega, x0, v0, t0, tf, dt):\n    t = np.arange(t0, tf, dt)\n    x = np.zeros(t.shape)\n    v = np.zeros(t.shape)\n    x[0], v[0] = x0, v0\n\n    for i in range(1, len(t)):\n        v[i] = v[i-1] - dt * omega**2 * x[i-1]\n        x[i] = x[i-1] + dt * v[i]\n\n    return t, x, v\n\n```\n\nWe now call the `euler` and `euler_cromer` functions and plot the position and velocity as a function of time. We do this by storing the position and velocity as `pandas` dataframes. This kind of data structure is useful for storing time series data and is easy to plot. It's a good idea to get in the habit of working with data structures like this.\n\n\nIn the resulting plots you can see how the Euler-Cromer method is more accurate than the Euler method. The Euler method has a systematic error that causes the amplitude of the oscillation to grow. The Euler-Cromer method does not have this problem.\n\n\n```python\nt, x, v = euler(omega, x0, v0, t0, tf, dt)\neulerdf = pd.DataFrame({'t': t, 'x': x, 'v': v})\n\nt, x, v = euler_cromer(omega, x0, v0, t0, tf, dt)\neuler_cromerdf = pd.DataFrame({'t': t, 'x': x, 'v': v})\n\neulerdf.head()\n```\n\n\n\n\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>t</th>\n      <th>x</th>\n      <th>v</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>0.00</td>\n      <td>1.0000</td>\n      <td>0.000000</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>0.01</td>\n      <td>1.0000</td>\n      <td>-0.010000</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>0.02</td>\n      <td>0.9999</td>\n      <td>-0.020000</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>0.03</td>\n      <td>0.9997</td>\n      <td>-0.029999</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>0.04</td>\n      <td>0.9994</td>\n      <td>-0.039996</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n```python\n# plot all positions vs time on the same graph\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))\nplt.plot(eulerdf['t'], eulerdf['x'], label='Euler')\nplt.plot(euler_cromerdf['t'], euler_cromerdf['x'], label='Euler-Cromer')\nplt.title('Position vs Time')\nplt.xlabel('Time (s)')\nplt.ylabel('Position (m)')\nplt.legend();\n```\n\n\n    \n![png](hw5_files/hw5_31_0.png)\n    \n\n\n* 6a (2pt) Graph the energy of the system as a function of time for both the Simple Euler and Euler-Cromer methods. You should use the same initial conditions and time step for both methods. What do you observe?\n\n* 6b (4pt) Write the exact solution for these initial conditions and compare the numerical solutions to the exact solution using a point-by-point measure. What do you observe? Come up with a measure of the overall error (or find one) in the numerical solution and discuss the results.\n\n* 6c (4pt) Write the code to solve the simple harmonic oscillator with second-order Runge Kutta (this needs to be from scratch, not using a library). You can use the lecture notes as a starting point.\n\n* 6d (2pt) Compare the results of this RK2 method to the previous methods. Use whatever comparison method you can develop or explain. Careful here because the time steps might not be the same for the different methods.\n\n* 6e (3pt) Look up `solve_ivp` in the `scipy` library and use it to solve the simple harmonic oscillator. Compare the results to the previous methods. What integrator are you using with `solve_ivp`? \n\n\n* 6f (15pt) Using your the integrator of your choosing, find numerical solutions for a given choice of initial conditions for each of the examples in exercise 5. Plot the phase diagram and the numerically computed trajectory on the phase diagram. See the example below for the simple harmonic oscillator. \n\n### Extra Credit - Integrating Classwork With Research\n\nThis opportunity will allow you to earn up to 5 extra credit points on a Homework per week.

The relevant reading background is:\n1. chapter 5 of Taylor \n\n2. chapter 6.6-6.8 of Boas\n\n3. chapters 2.0-2.3 and 5.0-5.2 of Strogatz\n\nIn both textbooks there are many nice worked out examples. \n\n\n### Practicalities about  homeworks and projects\n\n1.

For this homework this applies to exercises 1-5. Your jupyter notebook file should be converted to a **PDF** file, attached to the same PDF file as for the pencil and paper exercises. All files should be uploaded to Gradescope. \n\n**[Instructions for submitting to Gradescope](../resources/gradescope-submissions.md).**\n\n### Exercise 1 (10pt) Morse Potential as an SHO\n\nIf the potential has a local minimum, we can often find SHO approximation for that potential near the local minimum. \n\nThe [Morse potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_potential) is a convenient model for the potential energy of a diatomic molecule. The potential is a radial one and thus one-dimensional. It is given by,\n\n$$U(r) = A\\left[ \\left(e^{(R-r)/S}-1\\right)^2-1\\right]$$\n\nwhere the distance between the centers of the two atoms is $r$, and the constants $A$, $R$, and $S$ are all positive. Here $S<<R$.\n\n* 1a (2pt) Sketch (or plot) the potential as a function of $r$.\n* 1b (3pt) Find the equilibrium position of the potential, i.e. the position where the potential is at a minimum. We will call this $r_e$.\n* 1c (3pt) Rewrite the potential in terms of the displacement from equilibrium, $r = r_e + x$. Expand the potential to second order in $x$.\n* 1d (2pt) Find the effective spring constant, $k$, for the potential near the minimum. What is the frequency of small oscillations about the minimum?\n\n### Exercise 2 (10pt), Time Averaging and the SHO\n\nTime Averaging is a common tool to use with periodic systems. It also us to discuss what happens to different properties of the system over one period.\n\nAn SHO has a period $\\tau$. We can find the time average of a variable $f(t)$ over one period, $\\langle f \\rangle$, by averaging over the period,\n\n$$\\langle f \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\tau}\\int_0^\\tau f(t)dt$$\n\n* 2a (2pt) Show that the time average of the position of the SHO is zero.\n* 2b (2pt) Show that the time average of the velocity of the SHO is zero.\n* 2c (6pt) Show that the time average of the kinetic energy of the SHO is equal to the time average of the potential energy (and importantly, non-zero).  If the total energy is $E$, these time averages are equal to $E/2$. You might need to show that the very useful trigonometric identity,\n\n$$\\langle \\sin^2(\\omega t-\\delta)\\rangle = \\langle \\cos^2(\\omega t-\\delta)\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\n### Exercise 3 (10pt), Toy Potential\n\nConsider a toy potential of the form,\n\n$$U(r) = U_0\\left(\\dfrac{r}{R}+\\lambda^2\\frac{R}{r}\\right)$$\n\nwhere $U_0$, $R$, and $\\lambda$ are all positive constants and the domain of the potential is $0<r<\\infty$. \n\n* 3a (2pt) Sketch (or plot) the potential as a function of $r$.\n* 3b (3pt) Find the equilibrium position of the potential, i.e. the position where the potential is at a minimum. We will call this $r_e$.\n* 3c (5pt) Rewrite the potential in terms of the displacement from equilibrium, $r = r_e + x$. Expand the potential to second order in $x$. What is the effective spring constant, $k$, for the potential near the minimum? What is the frequency of small oscillations about the minimum?\n\n### Exercise 4 (10pt), Defining Periodicity\n\nA common issue with oscillators is determining their periodicity. For the SHO, we can show that the period is $2\\pi/\\omega_0$ where $\\omega_0$ is the natural frequency of the SHO. How might we define a periodicity more generally? Let's start with the damped harmonic oscillator. Consider a weakly damped oscillator ($\\beta < \\omega_0$). The motion of the oscillator is given by,\n\n$$x(t) = A e^{-\\beta t}\\cos(\\omega_1 t - \\delta)$$\n\nwhere $A$ is the amplitude, $\\beta$ is the damping constant, $\\omega_1 = \\sqrt{\\omega_0^2 - \\beta^2}$  and $\\delta$ is the phase.\n\nThe motion decays with time, but we can still define a periodicity, $\\tau_1$, which is the time between peaks in the motion.\n\n* 4a (4pt) Sketch (or plot) the motion of the oscillator as a function of time. Show that you can find $\\tau_1 = 2\\pi/\\omega_1$ from looking at successive maxima.\n* 4b (3pt) Show that an equivalent definition of $\\tau_1$ is twice the time between zero crossings of the motion.\n* 4c (3pt) If the damping $\\beta$ is half the natural frequency ($\\omega_0$), how does the amplitude of the motion decay in one period?\n\n### Exercise 5 (10pt), Planning your Final Project\n\nThe point of this exercise is to get you thinking about what you want to do for a final project and how you will accomplish it. Research and project planning are important skills to develop and it takes time to do so. We are trying to scaffold that development and give you the opportunity to practice these skills. So, you will be responsible for developing a plan for your final project, and the timeline under which you will accomplish it. Our job is to provide feedback and guidance on your plan, and to offer support in the development and construction of your final project.\n\n**Remember there is no right or wrong way to do this, it is about developing a plan that works for you.**\n\nYour final project is your chance to bring all the tools we have developed to bear on a question that interests you. You have reviewed the information on computational essays before, but here it is again in case it's useful for this exercise:\n\n1. Wolfram's [What is a Computational Essay?](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2017/11/what-is-a-computational-essay)\n2. Tor and my short paper: [Computational Essays: An Avenue for Scientific Creativity in Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12697)\n3. Wolfram's [Steps to Writing a Computational Essay](https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/Expositions/Published/ComputationalEssayGuidelines)\n4. [University of Oslo's Computational Essay Showroom](https://uio-ccse.github.io/computational-essay-showroom)\n\nFor your final project, you may work alone, in pairs, or in groups of up to three people. The expectation for your work will be higher if you have more people in your group; your explorations will need to be more comprehensive and detailed, and your essay will be expected to be longer and more polished if you have more people in your group. You can also develop more interesting ways of presenting your work that demonstrate the creativity and depth of your explorations if you have more people in your group. If you have any questions, just ask.\n\nFor this exercise, we want you to get started on planning your final project by sending us a brief proposal with a timeline. To help you, we have provided a schedule where you can see the checkpoints for your project, and when we will have a comprehensive work week. You should take advantage of the work week to make significant progress on your project; especially if there are technical aspects you are unsure about.\n\n#### Schedule for Final Project\n\n* 28 March - HW 7 will have a request for your 1st project update.\n* 11 Apr - Midterm Project 2 will have a request for your 2nd project update.\n* 18 Apr - HW 8 will have a request for your 3rd project update.\n* Week of 20-24 Apr - Project work week in-class.\n* 28 Apr - Final project due.\n\n#### Your Proposal\n\nYour proposal should be a one to two page, single spaced, document that outlines the following:\n\n1. The question you are interested in exploring. The motivation and interest to you and your group mates should be made clear. That is, motivate the question, why is it interesting?\n2. References that provide background for this work. This should include the sites, resources, and references you have consulted to get started.\n3. The approach you think you need to take to answer this question. Include the concepts and tools you plan to use to explore the question. That is, what have we developed in class that you will use to explore the question?\n4. The timeline for your project. This should include the checkpoints in the schedule above, and any additional milestones you think are important. Consider making a [Gantt chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart) to help you plan your project. This is a useful tool for planning and tracking your progress. It's almost expected for proposals in science and engineering. Here, We suggest you take advantage of the work week to make significant progress on or to polish your project.\n\n#### Your writing\n\nYou should consider this a formal proposal. It should be well written, clear, and concise. You should also consider the audience for this proposal. You should write this proposal for someone who is not in this class, but does know physics. Think about writing this to another student, a graduate student, or a professor. Someone that has a good understanding of physics, but not necessarily the details of your physics. You need to explain the motivation, the physics background, the approach, and the timeline in a way that is compelling and clear.\n\nYour proposal need not be long, but it should be complete. Here are some additional resources for you to develop a good proposal:\n\n- [NIH, How to write a research proposal?](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5037942/)\n- [University of Sheffield, How to write a research proposal](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/study-skills/research/methods/proposal)\n\n**Reference pages do not count towards the length, so if you have a lot of references, that's fine. But the main text should be one to two pages. This is how it works with most proposals in science and engineering.**\n\n\n### Exercise 6 (50 pt), Find your own 1D Oscillator\n\nWe have built all the tools to study 1D unforced oscillators. Now you get to pick your own potential and study it. You can pick any 1D potential you like, but it should have a local minimum. Make sure it is not a driven oscillator (i.e., no explicit time dependence in the equations of motion). To earn full credit for this exercise, you must:\n\n* 6a (5pt) Present the potential and describe its origin, why it is interesting, where it comes from, etc. Educate us about it.\n* 6b (5pt) Sketch (or plot) the potential as a function of it's argument (and chosen variables) and find the equilibrium position of the potential, i.e. the position where the potential is at a minimum. \n* 6c (10pt) Rewrite the potential in terms of the displacement from equilibrium. Expand the potential to second order to find the effective spring constant, $k$, for the potential near the minimum. What is the frequency of small oscillations about the minimum?\n* 6d (10pt) Construct the equations of motion for the potential and solve them numerically. Choose initial conditions and parameters that give oscillatory motion. Note it doesn't have to be SHO (In fact, it probably won't be). Plot the position as a function of time. Make sure we can see the oscillations.\n* 6e (10pt) Plot the phase diagram of the trajectory (you don't have to produce a phase diagram, but just plot the trajectory in phase space). What does the phase diagram tell you about the motion?\n* 6f (10pt) Find the period of your motion. Here you might have to make some definitions of what periodicity means for your potential.\n\n**Note: this might seem similar to your midterm, but notice we expect you to do some research on the potential in 6a, and we are going into more depth with questions 6e and 6f. This is also a scaffold for your final project in terms of practicing aspects that should appear.**\n\n\n#### Examples of 1D potentials\n\n##### Simple Pendulum (Nonlinear Small Angle Approximation)\n\n   $$ V(\\theta) = mgh(1 - \\cos(\\theta)) $$\n   where $m$ is the mass, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $h$ is the length of the pendulum, and $\\theta$ is the angular displacement.\n\n##### Nonlinear Spring (Hardening or Softening)\n\n   $$ V(x) = \\frac{k}{2} x^2 + \\frac{\\beta}{3} x^3 $$\n   where $k$ and $\\beta$ are constants. Depending on the sign of $\\beta$, the spring can exhibit hardening ($\\beta > 0$) or softening ($\\beta < 0$) nonlinearity.\n\n##### Lennard-Jones Potential Oscillator (for a diatomic molecule model):\n\n   $$ V(r) = 4\\epsilon \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right)^{12} - \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right)^6 \\right] $$\n   where $\\epsilon$ is the depth of the potential well, $\\sigma$ is the finite distance at which the inter-particle potential is zero, and $r$ is the distance between particles.\n\n##### Morse Potential (for molecular vibrations)\n\n   $$ V(x) = D_e \\left(1 - e^{-a(x - x_0)}\\right)^2 $$ \n   where $D_e$ is the depth of the potential well, $a$ is a constant related to the width of the well, $x$ is the displacement from equilibrium, and $x_0$ is the equilibrium bond length. This potential models the energy of a diatomic molecule as a function of the distance between atoms, showing oscillatory behavior that represents molecular vibrations.\n\n##### Double Well Potential\n\n   $$ V(x) = -\\frac{\\mu}{2} x^2 + \\frac{\\lambda}{4} x^4 $$\n   where $\\mu$ and $\\lambda$ are positive constants. This system exhibits bistability with two stable equilibria, leading to interesting nonlinear dynamics and potential oscillations between the wells under certain conditions.\n\n### Extra Credit - Integrating Classwork With Research\n\nThis opportunity will allow you to earn up to 5 extra credit points on a Homework per week.

The total energy for the oscillator is given by the sum of the kinetic and potential energies,\n\n$$E = \\frac{1}{2}m\\dot{x}^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2.$$\n\n* 1a (3pt). What is the energy per unit time dissipated by the damping force?\n* 1b (4pt). Take the time derivative of the total energy and show that it is equal (in magnitude) to the energy dissipated by the damping force.\n* 1c (3pt). What is the sign relationship between the energy dissipated by the damping force and the time derivative of the total energy?\n\n### Exercise 2 (10pt), Unpacking the critically damped solution\n\nThe solution for critical damping ($\\beta = \\omega_0$) is given by,\n\n$$x(t) = x_1(t) + x_2(t) = Ae^{-\\beta t} + Bte^{-\\beta t},$$\n\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants. Notice the second solution $x_2(t) = Bte^{-\\omega_0t}$ has an additional linear term $t$. We glossed over this solution in class, but it is important to understand why this term is present because it tells us about solving differential equations with pathologically difficult-to-see solutions.\n\nStart with the under damped solutions, \n\n$$y_1(t) = e^{-\\beta t}\\cos(\\omega_1 t) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y_2(t) = e^{-\\beta t}\\sin(\\omega_1 t),$$\n\nwhere we have used the notation $\\omega_1 = \\sqrt{\\omega_0^2 - \\beta^2}$.\n\n* 2a (3pt). Show that you can recover the first solution $x_1(t)$ by taking the limit of $\\beta \\rightarrow \\omega_0$ of $y_1(t)$.\n* 2b (3pt). Show that you cannot recover the second solution $x_2(t)$ by taking the limit of $\\beta \\rightarrow \\omega_0$ of $y_2(t)$ directly. What do you get?\n* 2c (4pt). If $\\beta \\neq \\omega_0$, you can divide $y_2(t)$ by $\\omega_1$. Now show that in the limit $\\beta \\rightarrow \\omega_0$ of $y_2(t)/\\omega_1$, we recover the form of $x_2(t)$.\n\n### Exercise 3 (20pt), Exploring the damped harmonic oscillator\n\nYou can choose to solve this exercise using analytical, or graphical methods. Should you decide to use numerical methods, you should make sure to use a method that conserves energy. However, this exercise does not need to be solved numerically as closed form solutions exist.\n\nThe solution to the simple harmonic oscillator is given by,\n\n$$x(t) = A_{sho}\\cos(\\omega_0 t) + B_{sho}\\sin(\\omega_0 t),$$\n\nwhere $A_{sho}$ and $B_{sho}$ are determined by the initial conditions. The solution to the underdamped harmonic oscillator is given by,\n\n\n$$x(t) = e^{-\\beta t}\\left(A\\cos(\\omega_1 t) + B\\sin(\\omega_1 t)\\right),$$\n\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are also determined by the initial conditions.\n\n#### Scenario 1\n\nAn undamped oscillator has a period $T_0 = 1.000\\mathrm{s}$, but then the damping is turned on. We observe the period increases by 0.001 seconds. \n\n* 3a (3pt). What is the damping coefficient $\\beta$?\n* 3b (3pt). By how much does the amplitude of the oscillation decrease after 10 periods?\n* 3c (3pt). What would be able to notice more easily, the change in period or the change in amplitude?\n\n#### Scenario 2\n\nAn undamped oscillator has a period $T_0 = 1.000\\mathrm{s}$. With weak damping, the amplitude drops by 50% in one period $T_1$. Recall the period of the damped oscillator is given by $T_1 = 2\\pi/\\omega_1$.\n\n* 3d (3pt). What is the damping coefficient $\\beta$?\n* 3e (3pt). What is the period of the damped oscillator?\n* 3f (3pt). By how much does the amplitude of the oscillation decrease after 10 periods?\n\n* 3g (2pt). What would be able to notice more easily, the change in period or the change in amplitude?\n\n\n### Exercise 4 (40pt), The Damped Driven Oscillator\n\nThe damped driven oscillator is described by the equation of motion,\n\n$$m\\ddot{x} + b\\dot{x} + kx = F(t),$$\n\nwhere $F_0$ is the amplitude of the driving force and $\\omega$ is the frequency of the driving force. We reduced this equation by dividing by $m$ to get the equation of motion in terms of the damping coefficient $\\beta = b/2m$ and the natural frequency $\\omega_0 = \\sqrt{k/m}$. In the equation below, $f(t) = F_0/m$.\n\n$$\\ddot{x} + 2\\beta\\dot{x} + \\omega_0^2x = f(t).$$\n\nWe solve this equation for sinusoidal driving forces, $f(t) = f_0\\cos(\\omega t)$ and demonstrated the resonance effect. In this exercise, we will numerically solve the equation of motion. This will allow us to explore the behavior of the damped driven oscillator for different periodic driving forces, not just sinusoidal ones.\n\n* 4a (10pt). Modify the code (or write your own) include a driving force $f(t) = f_0\\cos(\\omega t)$. \n    * To start, **choose $f_0$=1, $\\omega_0$=10 and $\\beta$=0.1.** \n    * Check that your code produces a steady state solution for the driven harmonic oscillator. Roughly, what is the steady state amplitude, $A(t \\rightarrow \\infty)$, of the driven oscillator?\n* 4b (10pt). For different choices of the driving frequency $\\omega$, observe the behavior of the driven oscillator. Describe the behavior of the driven oscillator for $\\omega \\ll \\omega_0$, $\\omega \\approx \\omega_0$, and $\\omega \\gg \\omega_0$.\n* 4c (20 pt). Sweep the driving frequency $\\omega$ at a fixed amplitude and store the amplitude of the steady-state solution. Plot the amplitude of the steady-state solution as a function of the driving frequency $\\omega$. Describe the behavior of the amplitude as a function of the driving frequency.\n\nWe have written a numerical solver for the damped undriven oscillator; it's similar to the prior codes we've used. Your task is to modify the code to include a driving force. We have used the second order Runge-Kutta method to solve the equation of motion. You can use the code as a starting point for the damped driven oscillator. Notice we also call the code in the next cell.\n\n\n```python\ndef ddho(y, t, omega_0, beta):\n    \"\"\"\n    Function to compute derivatives based on the damped driven oscillator model.\n    Notice the driving force is included but zero.\n    \"\"\"\n    x, v = y\n    dxdt = v\n    dvdt = -2 * beta * v - omega_0**2 * x\n    return np.array([dxdt, dvdt])\n\n\ndef rk2_step(y, t, dt, omega_0, beta, F0=1.0, omega=10, phase=0.0):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs a single step of the Runge-Kutta 2nd order (midpoint) method.\n\n    Parameters:\n    - y: current state [position, velocity].\n    - t: current time.\n    - dt: time step size.\n    - omega_0: natural frequency of the oscillator.\n    - beta: damping coefficient.\n    - F0: amplitude of the driving force.\n    - omega: frequency of the driving force.\n    - phase: phase of the driving force.\n\n    Returns:\n    - y_next: state at time step dt [position, velocity].\n    \"\"\"\n    k1 = ddho(y, t, omega_0, beta)\n    k2 = ddho(y + 0.5 * k1 * dt, t + 0.5 * dt, omega_0, beta)\n    y_next = y + k2 * dt\n    \n    return y_next\n```\n\n\n```python\n# Simulation parameters\nT = 100.0  # total time\ndt = 0.01  # time step\nomega_0 = 10  # natural frequency\nbeta = 0.1  # damping coefficient\n\nsteps = int(T / dt)\nt = np.linspace(0, T, steps)\ny = np.zeros((steps, 2))  # Array to hold position and velocity\n\n## Initial conditions\ny[0] = [0.25, 0.0]  # x=1, v=0\n\nfor i in range(steps - 1):\n    y[i + 1] = rk2_step(y[i], t[i], dt, omega_0, beta)\n\noscillator = pd.DataFrame(y, columns=[\"Position\", \"Velocity\"])\noscillator[\"Time\"] = t\n\n# Plotting the results\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))\nplt.plot(oscillator[\"Time\"], oscillator[\"Position\"], label=\"Damped Oscillator\")\nplt.axhline(0, color=\"black\", linewidth=1)\nplt.xlabel(\"Time\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Position\")\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.legend()\n```\n\n\n\n\n    <matplotlib.legend.Legend at 0x11bfac2d0>\n\n\n\n\n    \n![png](hw7_files/hw7_8_1.png)\n    \n\n\n### Exercise 5 (20pt), Project Check-in 1\n\nThis is the first of three check-ins for your final project. Last week, you submitted a project proposal with milestones. This week, you will submit a progress report. This is common in science and engineering research. Funding agencies require an annual report to ensure the project is on track. While we are not funding you, we want this work to be a similar experience to a research project.\n\nThe first annual report is often a minimal progress report. How much can you say? You have only just started! \n\nBut, you can say what you have done, what you are planning to do, what you have learned so far, and what changes you have to make. This is the purpose of this exercise.\n\n* 5a (5 pts). Review your project proposal. What have you been able to accomplish so far? What were you unable to do in the time you had? Be honest in your evaluation of your progress. You will not be penalized for not reaching your milestones. What does that mean you need to prioritize in the coming weeks? (at least 250 words)\n* 5b (5 pts). What problems did you encounter in doing you research? What questions came up and how did you resolve them? Are there any unresolved questions? (at least 250 words)\n* 5c (5 pts). Provide an artifact from your project. This could be a plot, a code snippet, a data set, or a figure. Explain what this artifact is and how it fits into your project. (at least 100-200 words)\n* 5d (5 pts). Update your project timeline and milestones. How will you adjust your timeline to account for the work you have done and the work you have left to do? (at least 100-200 words)\n\n### Extra Credit - Integrating Classwork With Research\n\nThis opportunity will allow you to earn up to 5 extra credit points on a Homework per week.

On a curved surface, the shortest distance will be a curve of some kind. In the exercise you will be asked to show that the shortest distance between two points on a sphere and a cylinder, both of fixed radii.\n\nA step in spherical coordinates is given by:\n\n$$d\\vec{s} = dr \\hat{r} + r d\\theta \\hat{\\theta} + r \\sin\\theta d\\phi \\hat{\\phi}.$$\n\nA step in cylindrical coordinates is given by:\n\n$$d\\vec{s} = d\\rho \\hat{\\rho} + \\rho d\\phi \\hat{\\phi} + dz \\hat{z}.$$\n\n1. (5 pt) Demonstrate the integral for the shortest distance between two points on a sphere of radius $R$ is given by:\n\n$$L = R \\int_{\\theta_1}^{\\theta_2} \\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\sin^2\\theta\\right) \\left(\\frac{d\\phi}{d\\theta}\\right)^2} d\\theta$$\n\nwhere $\\theta$ is the polar angle and $\\phi$ is the azimuthal angle. Note that you want to travel from ($\\theta_1, \\phi_1$) to ($\\theta_2, \\phi_2$) at fixed $R$.\n\n2. (5 pt) Construct the integral for the shortest distance between two points on a cylinder of radius $R$ and height $h$. The coordinates are $(R, \\phi_1, z_1)$ and $(R, \\phi_2, z_2)$ in the cylindrical coordinate system, where $\\rho$ is the radial difference, $\\phi$ is the azimuthal angle, and $z$ is the height.\n\n## Exercise 2 (15pt) Snell's Law\n\nWe can develop Snell's Law by minimizing the time it takes for light to travel between two points in different media. We note that the speed of light in a media is given by $v = c/n$, where $c$ is the speed of light in a vacuum and $n$ is the refractive index of the media. The time it takes for light to travel between two points is given by $t = L/v$, where $L$ is the distance between the two points.\n\nLet a light ray travel in a medium with refractive index $n_1$ into another medium with refractive index $n_2$. \n\n1. (5 pt) Sketch the problem and indicate the relevant angles and distances in your figure. Recall that the angle of incidence is $\\theta_1$ and the angle of refraction is $\\theta_2$. It is ok to use a 2D sketch.\n\n\n2. (5 pt) Set up the \"integral\" for the time it takes for light to travel between two points in different media. Use the fact that the speed of light in a media is given by $v = c/n$. Your answer needs to include the angles $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ and the refractive indices $n_1$ and $n_2$.\n\n\n\n3. (5 pt) Minimize the time it takes for light to travel between two points in different media to derive Snell's Law.\n\n$$n_1 \\sin\\theta_1 = n_2 \\sin\\theta_2$$\n\n## Exercise 3 (15pt) Lagrangian Examples\n\nConstructing the Lagrangian for a system can be a bit tricky. In this exercise you will be asked to construct the Lagrangian for a few systems and quickly find equations of motion to illustrate the process.\n\n1. (2 pt) Construct the Lagrangian in 3D for a projectile subject to no air resistance in a uniform gravitational field. The coordinates are $(x, y, z)$ in the Cartesian coordinate system. Find the 3 equations of motion.\n\n2. (2 pt) Construct the Lagrangian for a one-dimensional simple harmonic oscillator ($F=-kx$). The coordinate is $x$ in the Cartesian coordinate system. Find the equation of motion.\n\n3. (3 pt) A mass moves in a potential well $U(x,y) = \\frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + y^2)$. Construct the Lagrangian in 2D. The coordinates are $(x, y)$ in the Cartesian coordinate system. Find the 2 equations of motion.\n\nIt's common to use coordinates that are convenient for the problem. In these cases, you will need to write down the kinetic and potential energy in terms of the coordinates you choose. The single particle kinetic energy in these coordinates are commonly used.\n\n4. (4 pt) Write or derive the velocity vector in spherical coordinates. The coordinates are $(r, \\theta, \\phi)$ in the spherical coordinate system. Show the kinetic energy is given by $T = \\frac{1}{2}m(\\dot{r}^2 + r^2\\dot{\\theta}^2 + r^2\\sin^2\\theta\\dot{\\phi}^2)$.\n\n5. (4 pt) Write or derive the velocity vector in cylindrical coordinates. The coordinates are $(\\rho, \\phi, z)$ in the cylindrical coordinate system. Show the kinetic energy is given by $T = \\frac{1}{2}m(\\dot{\\rho}^2 + \\rho^2\\dot{\\phi}^2 + \\dot{z}^2)$.\n\n## Exercise 4 (25pt) Changing Coordinates\n\nConsider two particles with masses $m_1=m_2=m$ connected by a spring with spring constant $k$. They sit on a frictionless surface but are constrained to the $x$-axis. The location of the first particle is $x_1$ and the location of the second particle is $x_2$. The spring is at equilibrium when the particles are a distance $L$ apart. Assume the spring is massless and that the left mass never changes position with the right mass (i.e., the spring is always horizontal).\n\n1. (3 pt) Write down the kinetic and potential energy for this system in terms of $x_1$ and $x_2$ and their associated velocities.\n\n2. (4 pt) Write down the Lagrangian for this system in terms of $x_1$ and $x_2$ and their associated velocities $\\mathcal{L}(x_1, x_2, \\dot{x}_1, \\dot{x}_2)$. Find the 2 equations of motion.\n\n3. (5 pt) Now consider a new coordinate system where the center of mass is at $x_{cm} = \\frac{1}{2}(x_1 + x_2)$ and the relative coordinate is $x = x_1 - x_2$. Write down the kinetic and potential energy in terms of $x_{cm}$ and $x$ and their associated velocities.\n\n4. (8 pt) Write down the Lagrangian for this system in terms of the center of mass coordinate ($x_{cm}$) and the spring's extension ($x$) and the associated velocities $\\mathcal{L}(x_{cm}, x, \\dot{x}_{cm}, \\dot{x})$. Find the 2 equations of motion.\n5. (5 pt) Find $x_{cm}(t)$ and $x(t)$ for the system for some generic initial conditions of your choosing. Describe the motion of the system.\n\nIn this problem we are changing the coordinates to explore a different aspect of the problem (and to make the math easier). This is a common technique that will not always be obvious. But practice will help us identify when it is useful.\n\n## Exercise 5 (35 pt) Motion inside a paraboloid\n\nLet's figure out the motion of a particle stuck inside a paraboloid. The potential energy of the bead is given by $U = mgz$, where $m$ is the mass of the bead, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. The coordinates are $(x, y, z)$ in the Cartesian coordinate system.\n\n1. (5 pt) Write down the Lagrangian for the system in terms of $x$, $y$, and $z$ and their associated velocities $\\mathcal{L}(x, y, z, \\dot{x}, \\dot{y}, \\dot{z})$. Find the 3 equations of motion.\n\n2. (15 pt) The bead is constrained by the paraboloid $z = \\frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + y^2)$. Find the constraint equation and use it to eliminate one of the coordinates from the Lagrangian. Find the 2 equations of motion. Here it can be useful to change to cylindrical coordinates $(\\rho, \\phi, z)$. Hint it should be that the Lagrangian is a function of $\\rho$ and $\\phi$ and their associated velocities, $\\mathcal{L}(\\rho, \\dot{\\rho}, \\phi, \\dot{\\phi})$.\n\n3. (15 pt) For an initial condition where the bead is moving relative to the parabolic at some height above the bottom of the paraboloid, numerically solve the equations of motion (i.e., for $\\rho(t)$ and $\\phi(t)$) and plot the the motion of the bead. Does it stick to the paraboloid?\n\n## Exercise 6 (20pt), Project Check-in 3\n\nThis is the last of three check-ins for your final project. This week, you should be preparing to finish your computational essay. Following the posted [rubric](../resources/computational-essay-rubric.md) for the computational essay, you should reflect on your progress and update your project. This is a chance to evaluate where you are in the process of completing your computational essay.\n\n* 5a (5 pts). Review your project in the context of the rubric. What have you been able to accomplish so far? What were you unable to do in the time you had? Be honest in your evaluation of your progress. What do you have left to do? (at least 250 words)\n* 5b (5 pts). What problems did you encounter in doing you work? What questions came up and how did you resolve them? Are there any unresolved questions? (at least 250 words)\n* 5c (5 pts). Provide an artifact from your project. This could be a plot, a code snippet, a data set, or a figure. Explain what this artifact is and how it fits into your project. (at least 100-200 words)\n* 5d (5 pts). Update your project timeline and milestones. How will you adjust your timeline to account for the work you have done and the work you have left to do? How will you meet the expectations from the rubric? (at least 100-200 words)\n\n## Extra Credit - Integrating Classwork With Research\n\nThis opportunity will allow you to earn up to 5 extra credit points on a Homework per week. These points can push you above 100% or help make up for missed exercises.\nIn order to earn all points you must:\n\n1. Attend an MSU research talk (recommended research oriented Clubs is  provided below)\n\n2. Summarize the talk using at least 150 words\n\n3. Turn in the summary along with your Homework.\n\nApproved talks:\nTalks given by researchers through the following clubs:\n* Research and Idea Sharing Enterprise (RAISE)\u200b: Meets Wednesday Nights Society for Physics Students (SPS)\u200b: Meets Monday Nights\n\n* Astronomy Club\u200b: Meets Monday Nights\n\n* Facility For Rare Isotope Beam (FRIB) Seminars: \u200bOccur multiple times a week\n\n\n"
